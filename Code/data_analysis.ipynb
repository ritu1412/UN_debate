His election to this high office is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities and experience. I am fully confident that under his able and wise leadership the Assembly will further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.\\nMy delegation associates itself with previous speakers in expressing its appreciation of the dedicated efforts of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\\nAs in previous years, my delegation wishes to note its satisfaction with and gratitude for the assiduous and unrelenting efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the cause of peace and international harmony. We pay a tribute to him for his untiring efforts to promote conditions conducive to the realization of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, we praise and congratulate him on the successes the Organization has achieved in recent years. More particularly we praise him for the renewed faith and regeneration of confidence in the Organization and its ability to Play an instrumental role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  \\nToday we find ourselves at an important crossroads. Recent years have witnessed a welcome positive change in the international political climate. The confrontational tone evident in super-Power relations not too long ago continues to show signs of thawing. At the same time,, a number of regional and sub regional conflicts have taken momentous strides towards resolution. Many more protracted conflicts show signs of hope and movement. Though one might argue that the present situation continues to be delicate, the process made can hardly escape notice and is indeed worthy of recognition. \\nDevelopments in southern Africa, and more particularly in Namibia with regard to the implementation of the United Nations independence plan, are welcome signals of hope, but amidst the hopes there are still dark reminders of the precariousness of global political reconciliation. A number of problems remain unsolved and several of these, such as the conflicts in the Middle East, continue to simmer.\\nWe are therefore at an important crossroads. We feel that there is enough good will to set in motion the process of evolution towards peace and stability. We see signs that the human intellect is resourceful enough to devise ideas that are conducive to our survival. Fresh concepts of peace and security have gained currency, but at the same time we continue to live under the dark shadow of nuclear devices. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, both horizontally and vertically, is a tragic reminder of the difficulties and obstacles which stand between mankind and lasting peace.\\nOn the economic front hard choices need to be made. The 1980s have witnessed one of the longest spells of growth for the industrialized countries, while the situation in the South, particularly in the least developed countries, continues to deteriorate. Benefits of trade continue to be disproportionate. Commodity prices have not regained their value in real terms. Aid flows continue to be inadequate. The debt burden borne by many third world countries is stifling economic growth and efforts for development, causing political instability. The link between economic development and the environment has recently been recognized and it is encouraging to note the high profile given to environmental issues at the Paris summit meeting of the Group of Seven in July this year, in this regard, it is of particular interest that there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the fact that certain technologies have a deleterious effect on the environment. The question is how these technologies can be replaced through a global programme of co-operation.\\nNo single fact, no single object, defines our moment in civilization more than does the existence of large nuclear arsenals. we have the horrible capacity to destroy our planet several times other, either by accident or by design. Nuclear weapons instil fear and beget mistrust and insecurity. They have a remarkable tendency to set hostile relations in concrete. They aggravate the security dilemma of states and perpetuate a confliction mode of behaviour. This, therefore, fuels the arms race and defence budgets soar while expenditures that are benevolent tend to plummet. \\nThe UN Conference on the relationship between disarmament and development served as a timely reminder of the opportunity costs of armaments, both nuclear and conventional. However the opportunity cost of nuclear weaponry is not only development. The international political climate and the security perceptions of states, as well as the environment, are actual and potential sacrifices to\\nnuclear weapons. Furthermore. the potential horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons issues the stark and grim warning that regional rivalries would be on an ever shorter fuse and that cataclysm would be that much closer.\\nIt is in view of these strong objections  to nuclear weapons and their Proliferation and deployment that my delegation has consistently and strongly supported United Nations calls for disarmament.\\nThe confidence that can he derived from genuine arms reduction has a pervasive effect on the security environment. The transition that many of the world's conflict, are making towards negotiations and understanding owes a great deal to improved relations between the super-Powers, which were themselves in part inspired by the historic arms reduction agreement of December 1987 for this reason -at Maldives has always supported all efforts with a view to general and complete disarmament, including the total elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and reduction in conventional armaments. We also believe that nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace could inspire trust, good Will and operation among states, transforming into secure communities contributing to global peace and security. We therefore support calls for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. \\nI express my delegation's fullest support for the people of Namibia, with our Namibia achieved their independence.  Apartheid is an affront to mankind and a crime against humanity. No amount of tinkering with it can placate the sense of outrage and indignation felt by the world community for this immoral practice. No amount of cosmetic change can restore Justice and dignity to the oppressed majority in South Africa. Maldives express our solidarity with the oppressed majority in South Africa in their struggle against apartheid. We condemn unequivocally the system of apartheid and condemn Pretoria regime for its continued defiance of the UN resolutions.  \\nBy far the greatest conflict in our time has been and continues to be the conflict in the Middle East. At the heart of this conflict is the question of Palestine. However, it is only in recent years that the Palestinian issue has evoked even a reasoned amount of concern in some key States. The search for peace continues to be frustrated by the hard-line and obstinate policies of Israel. Meanwhile, the situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate. The 22 month long intifadah emphasizes the intensity of the situation posed by Zionist occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories, including Jerusalem.\\nThe Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the blatant abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We also deplore the continued defiance by Israel of United Nations resolutions and its violation of international law and all norms of civilized behaviour. We reiterate our full support and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for self-determination and independence. We therefore welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising, which is being viewed as the just and valiant struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable rights. We extend our whole-hearted support to the proposal for an early convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the full and independent participation of Palestine.\\nThe situation in Lebanon remains volatile. The civil war, now in its fifteenth year, continues to take an increasing toll of human life. We fervently hope that, with the developments taking place in the region and elsewhere, the question of Lebanon will be solved in a manner which will restore its independence and national integrity, and alleviate the sufferings of its people. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the members of the Arab league, both past and present, to resolve the situation in Lebanon and we request the international community to give their support to the people of Lebanon in their efforts to solve their problems.\\nOn a more hopeful note, we are pleased that, contrary to some early pessimistic assessments, the cease-fire agreed on between Iran and Iraq in the Gulf has held firm, indicating the sincerity of the parties to the conflict. We welcome the commitments undertaken by them to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. In particular, we applaud the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General for the resolution of this conflict and urge both parties to maintain the momentum of peace created and envisaged by the cease-fire. \\nWhile we welcome the positive developments in Afghanistan - I refer to the withdraw of foreign troops - we regret that the situation has not been completely settled. We reiterate our call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the provisions of the Geneva Agreements in order not to frustrate the prevailing opportunities for a just and lasting solution to the problem. We urge the international community to provide humanitarian and economic assistance for the relief and rehabilitation of refugees, as well as for the long-term reconstruction of that ravaged country.  \\nPositive strides have been taken towards the solution of the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the withdraw of the Vietnamese troops and we appreciate the diplomatic efforts to obtain a comprehensive and lasting solution to the dispute including the Jakarta informal meeting as well as the international conference in Paris. However, realizing the delicacy of the current situation, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint. \\nThe process of reunification of peoples should be through peaceful means and by the creation of conditions conducive to reconciliation, peace and stability among those sharing the same aspirations. We remain optimistic about the prospects for peaceful national reconciliation in the Korean peninsula. The good office of the UN could be utilized in these peace negotiations.  \\nAnother issue that needs our attention is the situation in Cyprus. That prolonged inter-communal dispute should be solved urgently, with due regard to the national integrity of the nation and the aspirations of its peoples. We welcome the recent high-level contacts between the two communities and hope that the revived inter-communal dialogue will lead to inter-communal reconciliation on the basis of equality and integrity for both communities. We commend the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in searching for a settlement to the conflict.\\nAs I have already noted, the world economic situation continues to be bleak for the developing countries. Their situation has been worsened by the limited of aid since the early 1980s, rampant domestic inflation, crippling debts and the exorbitant burden of debt-servicing. The situation is aggravated by their falling share in international trade, by persistent negative trends in the terms of trade, owing to protectionism, and by the upsurge in unilateralism and other practices that jeopardize the multilateral nature of trade. It is regrettable that, on the whole, despite recent measures whereby the resources of the international finance institutions have been increased by the plans of some of the most developed countries to recycle part of their surplus into the developing countries, the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance has not been met. Moreover, as regards the least developed countries, which continue to register negative growth rates, the official development assistance target of 0.15 per cent of GNP has not been met either.\\nEconomic insecurity is not the only visible threat facing many of us in the world today. Indeed, we consider the environment to be one of the most important aspects of the quality of life that we have to address now in our quest for economic and industrial development. We welcome the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development and regard the event as a valuable opportunity which should be fully utilized to promote a comprehensive approach to the environmental problems related to the development activities of mankind.\\nWhile serious efforts are being made at global, regional and national levels to protect the environment, my delegation is particularly concerned about the effects of the degradation of the environment, especially the depletion of the ozone layer and the consequent global warming and rise in sea level. Maldives is a low-lying archipelagic State, entirely dependent upon its surrounding seas. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem, or any rise in the mean sea level, is a matter of grave concern to the Maldives, it will be recalled that two years ago we witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions, which caused extensive damage, with the assistance of friendly countries, we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated islands from possible natural calamities. Tidal waves, hurricanes and typhoons are increasingly frequent phenomena, and today there is a greater awareness that man's tampering with the environment and certain technologies inimical to the environment do have a direct bearing on the behaviour of the global weather system.\\nMaldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Our interest in the issue continues undiminished, and we welcome the universal interest that has been expressed in the preservation of the environment. I should like also to mention that in November this year the Maldives will host a conference of small States on sea-level rise. We are confident that the conference will contribute to the global efforts in addressing this important issue.\\nIt is an old and true maxim that the best indicator of the strength and stability of an international security system or political order is the survival of its weakest members. That being the case, and in view of the implications, the ever-increasing dangers of terrorism and mercenarism to the sovereignty of small and weak States are appalling.\\nTerrorism is not simply a minor irritant to anybody - least of all, to the small nations whose sovereignty is not only held hostage but can be easily usurped. The very existence of this possibility in the first place does not augur well for the security of the international community. The cherished principles that have so long contributed to the survival of the present State system and that are indispensable values of our global civilization are at stake. Today it may be we, the small States, whose sovereignty can be robbed by a handful of mercenaries or a gang of bounty hunters. Tomorrow it could be the larger countries, which, even at present, face some erosion of their sovereignty and security by similar acts. The difference is that when a small State is subjected to a terrorist onslaught or an invasion by mercenaries the consequences can be irreversible, both in political and in economic terms. We in the Maldives were close to becoming the victim of such a dastardly attempt last November.\\nIt is evident that peoples engaging in acts of terrorism and mercenarism, which endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, need to be deterred. The security of small States is too weak to be taken care of by mere self-help. The implications that efforts to strengthen their own security have for the prospects of economic development through the severe, if at all affordable, opportunity costs and the impact on social and political values, as well as the long-term implications for the sustenance of democracy in a militarised society, are negative. By requesting the inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly of an item related to the protection and security of small States, we sought to highlight the issue that I have just mentioned. We brought the issue to this forum not because we are unwilling to defend our values, nor have we taken it up here because our peoples lack valour. \\nSmall States do have as friends States that can assist, and have assisted, in strengthening their security. While we are grateful for the sense of duty that these friends have shown, it is with regret that we note that bilateral security arrangements in the international system have not yet evolved to a level of maturity whereby the interests of the weaker partner can be safeguarded. Nor are the socio-political identity of the weaker State and the principle of sovereign equality strong enough to be impervious to the possible vicissitudes of unequal relationships. Moreover, our political systems continue to be afflicted by misconceptions which can distort actions taken with the best of intentions. Consequently, the greater the power differential, the greater the propensity to misconceptions and the more hapless the predicament of the weaker parties. It is for this reason that we believe that multilateral frameworks are the most feasible nodes of a sound security mechanism for the weakest Members of the Organization, even if the actual support or assistance in a given situation is rendered at a regional or bilateral level.\\nAs I noted earlier, it is my humble opinion that we are at a pivotal point, an important crossroads in our global political development. It is our belief that we are at a particularly auspicious moment in history to forge ahead in strengthening the norms of our global political and security systems. Thus it is our sincere hope that the Organization will take a similar momentous step, a leap forward in ushering in a new era of security for the small States. We trust that this critical step will be taken to safeguard the principles which are espoused by the Organization and on which the survival of a large number of this community depends.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>﻿\\nMay I begin by congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your wide experience in the United Nations makes you especially qualified to guide the Assembly and its deliberations. You have my best wishes for the demanding task that lies ahead of you. May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General. We owe a great deal to his authority and leadership.\\nAs we are assembled here for the annual general debate, every Member state needs to reflect on certain fundamental questions. Is the United Nations doing everything possible in order to meet its challenges? Are we making progress? Can we say that the United Nations enters the last decade of this century with determination and justified self-confidence? Is my own country doing everything it can in order to help the world Organization? The answers to these questions must be sought in the actual work of the Organization and of its Member States. For my part, I shall try to emphasize some of the challenges we in Finland regard as particularly imports at the present time. It seems to us that the main challenges can be expressed in two words -insecurity and poverty. Both produce fear  d suffering. Neither can be dealt with by any single remedy.\\nThe United Nations was created first and foremost in order to maintain international peace and security. In this respect, the past year represents a mixture of success and disappointment. We are encouraged by the high-level dialogues that have continued between the major Powers. we have witnessed with satisfaction such concrete achievements as the continuing progress in the verified dismantling and destruction of American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. As one of the participating States in the process of the Conference on Security and cooperation in Europe, Finland follow, closely and with ,much hope the new efforts to achieve substantive conventional disarmament in Europe.\\nAt the same time we are concerned about the violence that has erupted and continues in many parts of the world. Most of the underlying problem are already on the agenda of the General Assembly, and we shall express our views on them in due course. Now I want to speak about the global challenges. As regards the process of disarmament on the global level our hopes in Finland are fastened particularly on the preparation of a chemical weapons convention. The political will is there, as was demonstrated again at the conferences held in Paris and in Canberra this year. During this year, as before, Finnish experts have continued their research in order to help to develop appropriate methods that could meet the complex verification requirements  global and comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We expect progress from the protracted negotiations with growing impatience. We welcome the impetus recently given them in the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.\\nSecurity on the global level must take into account other factors in addition to armaments and military threats. Security requires confidence in the future. Such confidence must be felt both by Governments and by their peoples. Only a representative Government that respects human rights and that therefore enjoys the confidence of its own people can face the future with a sense of security and successfully maintain stable relations with other Governments. Some dramatic - in fact, tragic - events have recently illustrated the importance of respect for human rights. We hope that lessons have been learned.\\nConfidence in the future also requires that the other global challenge, that of poverty, be overcome. The sufferings of poverty may not be in evidence everywhere, but the challenge requires global co-operation for development. The Assembly will meet next year in a special session devoted to international economic co-operation. Soon thereafter a new international development strategy for the 1990s should be adopted. A successful special session and a new and realistic strategy should help to bring about a new spirit of international economic co-operation.\\nIn the process of preparing both the development strategy and the special session emphasis should be on the development of human resources in all forms, including the recognition of a well-functioning private sector in balance with an effective public sector. In that context funding generated by national and international sources should be well co-ordinated. The necessary investments in developing countries require increasing domestic and external financing.\\nThe debt overhang has resulted in the transfer of resources from developing countries, which exceeded $US 50 billion last year, a trend that should be reversed. This requires that a political solution, including a functioning debt strategy, be found. The debt overhang cannot be overcome by the international community at the upcoming special session of the General Assembly and in the new international development strategy. It would be important for the efforts to reverse the transfer of resources from the developing countries if the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as development-and transfer were generally reached. For its part, Finland will this year reach that target set by the General Assembly.\\nThe structure of the United Nations in the economic and social fields should respond to the tasks to be specified in the strategy for the 1990s, thus -consolidating the role of the world Organization. The Finnish Government finds that the Secretary-General has a major catalytic role to play in putting forward concrete proposals to improve the Organization's effectiveness in those fields. That would also help Governments in agreeing on the areas where they are to concentrate the activities of the United Nations in the economic and social fields. Today I wish to emphasize two issues that must, in my opinion, have a Prominent place in this respect. Development cannot be sustainable if the world population continues to grow at its present rate. Development cannot be sustainable if the natural resources of the Earth continue to be depleted at the present rate. There is a growing awareness of such problems in all parts of the world. That awareness is more and more strongly reflected in the work of the United Nations, it has prompted a number of positive measures. More is needed.\\nAccording to recent United Nations estimates the world population could stabilize in the twenty-first century at the level of 10 to 11 billion persons. An early stabilisation of population growth would, of course, facilitate the fight against poverty. To reach that goal, determined population policies, translated into national population plans as spelled out in the World Population Plan of Action, should be pursued vigorously.\\nWith regard to the protection of the environment, no problem has lately become\\nso apparent and widely recognized as the problem of climate change. Both industrialized and developing countries are directly affected by the depletion of the ozone layer through increasing emissions of carbon dioxides, which produce the so-called greenhouse effect in the climate of the Earth, and by the increasing presence of substances in the atmosphere that cause acid rain and direct dangers to health.\\nIt is therefore hardly a surprise that we have witnessed increasing international activity in this field. Several initiatives have been taken to launch concerted international action to combat atmospheric pollution in all its aspects, including climatic change. It is our view that effective strategies and policies should be developed by the international community as soon as possible in all fields relating to environment. That is a major undertaking that requires consolidated effort by the General Assembly and by the relevant United Nations specialized and other agencies. Environmental problems have a universal character. Any new activities should be streamlined with already ongoing action and well-established treaty-making procedures. The General Assembly must play a pivotal role in that effort.\\nFive months ago Finland hosted a Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer aid the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Those instruments, of 1985 and 1987 respectively, have this year already been found inadequate in light of the latest advances in knowledge. At the Conference the representatives of the more than 80 States present agreed unanimously to the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of  the Ozone Layer, which contains an ambitious undertaking to phase out completely the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000, or sooner if possible, and to phase out other ozone-depleting substances as soon as possible. We expect that undertaking to be converted into a legally binding decision at next year's meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Appropriate measures should also be undertaken to make environmentally sound substitutes widely available to developing countries as soon as possible.\\nIn the field of environment protection the problems that are typical in the industrialized countries are often also found in the big urban centres of the developing countries. The problems that are now typical in many developing countries - such as soil erosion and the destruction of forests - illustrate mistakes already committed by earlier generations, most of all in Europe. We can therefore all learn from each other. There is information available about the environment and its protection, and about earlier mistakes. The available knowledge needs to be applied and converted into practical programmes, not only on the level of global strategies, but also on the level of regional, national and local development.\\nIn our own development co-operation programmes, we in Finland have emphasized such activities as deforestation, where we feel that we have some experience and expertise. We see deforestation as urgent in order to help stop soil erosion, counteract the greenhouse effect and counterbalance the continued cutting of trees for fuel and for other immediate human needs. In this respect, the development of new and renewable soirees of energy is of crucial importance.\\nOn a broader scale, we look forward to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We see it as representing probably the most important joint effort required of mankind during the remaining part of this century. This session of the General Assembly is called upon to take important decisions for the preparation of the Conference. In that connection, as in all our activities to face up to environmental problems, we in Finland will strongly emphasize the need to support the developing countries in order to ensure that their development is environmentally sustainable.\\nA large part of the burden, particularly for financing research and the introduction of new environmentally sound technologies, will have to be borne by the industrialized countries. We accept our part of this burden, knowing of course that all states will have to share in the efforts according to their capabilities. Since concern for the environment is global, this concern should in our opinion give a further incentive to all States without exception to involve themselves\\nactively in international co-operation for environmentally sound and sustainable development. We also think that the time is ripe for the preparation of structural reforms making the United Nations Organization more responsive to the problems of protecting the environment. My Government has an open mind regarding the various ideas that have been discussed. We would find it natural for this Assembly to take decisions ensuring environmental Questions a permanent and prominent place in the structure of the Organization.\\nOne of the activities of the United Nations which has rightly gained prominence during this year is peace-keeping. At the present time, Finland is the biggest contributor of personnel to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Their total strength is close to 15,000, and the number of Finnish personnel is now almost 2,000. It is therefore with particular satisfaction that we in Finland share the pride felt in this house over the latest Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In co-operation with the other Nordic countries, Finland has this year taken steps to share with other interested States its experiences concerning the training and preparation of national contingents for peace-keeping tasks.\\nWe are also satisfied at the reactivation of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. The accumulated experiences in this field have already grown to such an extent that it is high time indeed to make a thorough review of all practical proposals that may help to strengthen the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping.\\nIn this connection, I wish to emphasize the importance of finding a lasting solution to the financial difficulties that still affect current peace-keeping operations, thus indirectly undermining the financial basis of the whole Organization. The idea of having sufficient financial reserves for peacemaking and peace-keeping, particularly for the start-up phase of operations, which my   predecessor put forward in his address to the General Assembly last year, has received support in a number of Quarters. I note in particular that the Secretary-General, in his own report to the General Assembly, has referred to the possibility of establishing a special reserve fund for peace-keeping, to be supported by all Member States. We hope that this idea can soon be followed up in practice with full respect for the principle of collective responsibility. The first condition, in our view, is that Member states should accept the principle of financing all operations without exception through assessed contributions and that they should pay all their assessed contributions in full and on time.\\nThe principal factor explaining the recent growth in the participation of Finnish personnel in United Nations peace-keeping is the deployment of an enlarged battalion within the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. A sizable number of volunteer soldiers has thus been added to the two Finnish battalions and smaller units already serving in the Middle East and elsewhere.\\nNamibia is a major test for the United Nations. The beginnings of the UOTAG operations to implement Security Council resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia were unexpectedly rough and difficult. It is still too early to draw conclusions from the whole process of transition to independence, but we believe that the programme has been brought back on track thanks to the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General and the competent performance of the UNTAG personnel. Of course, many problems still remain to be solved and call for our unrelenting attention. We are looking forward with confidence to the moment when we can welcome independent Namibia into our midst as a Member State of the United Nations. For Finland, Namibia will be a major partner in our development co-operation.  The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a persistent threat to international security. The dangers of the absence of peace in the area are demonstrated almost daily. Repressive measures continue in the territories illegally occupied by Israel. The cycle of violence has not been broken. The\\neking turmoil in Lebanon gives cause for deep concern. There must be a way to or the suffering of the Lebanese people by the common endeavours of the Lebanese themselves, the Arab League and the international community.\\nIt is pressingly urgent that the way should be prepared towards an international peace conference and, further, to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. There is an almost universal recognition of the basic principles for a settlement. The right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries, as well as the right of the Palestinians to national determination, should be recognised. Democratic elections in the occupied territories could facilitate this process. If such elections are properly mentored and take place within the framework of a structured effort, they could provide a link in a process leading to a comprehensive settlement. The momentum for achieving a solution to this long-standing conflict will be lost unless all possible avenues are pursued vigorously and with an open mind. In this respect, the proposals made by President Mubarak of Egypt are welcome and merit serious consideration.\\nThe United Nations has manifestly demonstrated its relevance and strengthened its role as a forum for co-ordinated international action. Yet the world Organization and its member States can do more. Serious global problems call for urgent global solutions. Only a re-invigorated United Nations can answer the challenges the world will inevitably face in the 1990s and beyond. Let us unite our forces to make the United Nations capable of meeting those challenges. \\n</td>\n",

Finally, it is a tribute paid to Africa as a whole. I wish to assure you of the complete availability and co-operation of my delegation in helping you to accomplish your task.\\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, we would like to express out full appreciation and gratitude for the wisdom, skill and efficiency with which he presided over the work of the forty-third session.\\nlb the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, I should like to repeat the whole-hearted support and encouragement of General Ali Saibou, President of the Supreme Council of National Guidance, Head of State, for the tireless efforts he is making on behalf of peace. We commend the dynamic work the Secretary-General has carried out at the head of this Organization, which he has now rehabilitated and whose authority, prestige and credibility he has restored.\\nFinally, I welcome Mr. Ronald Spiers, the new Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, who succeeds Ambassador Reed. We wish him every success in the accomplishment of his new task.\\nThe sessions of the General Assembly are opportunities for the international community to make further progress in the quest for peace, justice and harmony among peoples in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter. It is in this spirit that the delegation of Niger intends once again to make its contribution to the bread discussion of problems of concern to humanity.\\nSwift and profound changes are taking place in the international arena. We are seeing political, economic, social, cultural and even ideological changes which are shaping and foreshadowing international relations and the new stakes and challenges of the next century. These changes are sure to have a decisive influence on the future of nations and peoples.\\nThe new dynamic in the feature of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly with the signature and entry into force of the Treaty on the Elimination of Their Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, is grounds for hope. That agreement and the thaw in relations between the two super-Powers has created a general climate of co-operation and detente and has helped to prepare the way for the settlement of several regional and local conflicts.\\nThe treaties and agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States are basic attainments} they testify to the political will of those two countries to curb the danger which the arms race represents for mankind. We must however note that the danger continues because the means of warfare are of necessity lethal, are still considerable and are increasingly sophisticated. For that reason the two super-Powers should intensify and pursue, with greater determination and will, their negotiations on the reduction of their stockpiles both nuclear and conventional.\\nIn this respect we are pleased with the constructive proposals made a few days ago from this rostrum, by the President of the United States of America and the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs respectively, with regard to the elimination of chemical weapons and of conventional weapons. These proposals, if accepted by both parties, would, we believe, help to promote substantial progress towards general and complete disarmament.\\nThe survival of mankind is our common responsibility and implies that we must avoid a nuclear disaster, which is still possible, by significantly reversing present trends. It is certainly frustrating to note the state of the world today and to see that today we have a striking if not repugnant paradox on the one hand there is the exponential increase in military budgets, and arsenals and on the other there is the chronic poverty and wretchedness of many in the world We must give full weight to the Action Programme adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which provides for the creation of institutional financial mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of resources saved through disarmament measures to economic and social development activities.\\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when significant and encouraging progress has been noted in many regional conflicts, some of which have been controlled and virtually settled thanks to the merits of dialogue and negotiation, while others are on the right path with good chances of success. However, the persistence of stubborn hotbeds of tension or situations of injustice and the appearance or intensification of certain disputes still pose a dangerous threat to international peace and security in many regions of the world.\\nWe must work tirelessly, and persevere in the quest for and consolidation of peace. He must take advantage of this thaw in international relations to make significant advances towards the realization of our peoples' legitimate aspiration to peace, justice and human dignity.\\nIn Africa, the situation in Namibia and South Africa continues to centre on the long-awaited outcome of the Namibian people's heroic struggle for independence and on tine persistence of the despicable system of apartheid. The international community's tireless efforts are finally about to bear fruits the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia has been under way since 1 April 1989. Yet it is more indispensable than ever before to show determination, vigilance and solidarity to prevent the Pretoria racist regime from crushing our efforts.\\nUnfortunately, I must condemn yet again tine intimidation and harassment against the freedom-fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SHAFO), the reprisals perpetrated by the sinister Koevoet forces, the manipulation of electoral rolls, the assassination of Namibian patriots and SHAFO leaders, such as the 12 September murder of Anton Lubowski. All these acts testify to the disarray of the racist regime and remind us that there are still many real dangers that the process will be derailed, and that constant vigilance is required.\\nIt is the duty of the Organization, the permanent members of the Security Council and the entire international community to ensure that the spirit and the letter of Security Council resolutions 435 (1578) and 632 (1989) are scrupulously respected by all parties and that the Namibian people has the opportunity and means to elect a Government of Its choice next month freely, peacefully and without manoeuvres, intimidation or coercion.\\nIn South Africa itself, apartheid persists, The new political leadership of the country is aiming to win time through various subterfuges. He must not be Misled by recent declarations of purely superficial constitutional reforms or by the pseudo-elections of 6 September last. They leave untouched the real problem: the perpetuation of the apartheid system, which denies the black majority the right to participate fully in the political and democratic management of its country.\\nMr. President, as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid you are very well aware that apartheid cannot be reformed. It is a disgrace to humanity and an anachronism of world civilization; it must be dismantled, pure and simple. But we note that the friends of the South African regime still hesitate to adopt bold sanctions against the apartheid regime. They must understand and weigh the danger to themselves of stubborn support - even passive support - for a system founded on inequality, exploitation and the denial of human rights.\\nFor that reason, Niger appeals again to the international community to maintain and indeed increase its pressure on the South African regime, so the comprehensive mandatory sanctions ordered by the Security Council and the General Assembly in the relevant resolutions can be effectively imposed against South Africa. Only such sanctions will make it see reason and lift its policy of internal repression and destabilization of neighbouring States, lift the bans that hobble the anti-apartheid movement, and immediately and unconditionally free all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, Today more than ever before, this is a matter of a true social pact and a duty of genuine solidarity for the international community vis-à-vis the South African people and all the peoples of southern Africa.\\nWe call on the international community to support fully the conclusions reached by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which met at Harare on 21 August and adopted a declaration on the peace process in southern Africa. We call on it firmly to support the Gbadolite agreements of 22 June last and all the efforts to restore peace in Angola, and to encourage similar initiatives for national reconciliation and the restoration of peace in Mozambique,\\nA local conflict that has just exploded on our continent is causing us great concern and sadness, for it concerns two fraternal countries that are dear to us two countries that should stand united and cleave to one another; two countries members of the organization for the Development of the Senegal River, the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel, the West African Economic Community, the Economic Community of West African States, the OAU, the organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\\nAs a member of the ministerial mediation commission established by the organization of African Unity, Niger is working with the other member countries towards the prompt and final settlement of this unfortunate affair. We therefore take this opportunity to renew our appeal to Senegal and Mauritania to refrain from any action that could increase tension, and to co-operate fully with the African mediation commission in its efforts to restore as soon as possible between the two peoples the understanding, harmony, fraternity, solidarity and common destiny to which geography, history and the Islamic faith destine - I was about to say doom - them.\\nI am pleased to note that between Chad and Libya - two other fraternal countries that are neighbours of Niger - dialogue is continuing and strengthening ever time, thus promoting a comprehensive, final settlement of the dispute that has long set them against one another and that has cost their peoples so dearly. Niger welcomed the conclusion on 31 August of the Algiers agreement, which consolidated the cease-fire and ushered in a new era of peace, mutual trust and fraternal\\nco-operation for the two countries. We congratulate them and urge them to sustain this momentum in the interest of their peoples arid the entire sub region.\\nIn Western Sahara, the process begun by the Secretary-General's peace plan and conducted jointly with the current Chairman of the OAU is under way, and we support it. We urge the parties involved in this painful conflict to continue and indeed intensify their efforts to create conditions that would favour the organization under United Nations auspices of a referendum on self-determination.\\nIn the Middle East, the Palestinian people is heroically continuing its resistance to illegal occupation and repression. The conditions, the framework and the means for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East are well known. They include the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, the strict implementation in that connection of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the convoking under United Nations auspices of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). There is no possible alternative to those conditions and their complete implementation} otherwise there can be no fair and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\\nAlong with the rest of the international community, Niger welcomed the peace initiative announced on 13 December 1988 in Geneva, and the many peaceful overtures made by the PLO. We therefore regret the lack of a positive response from the Israeli Government to the Palestinian side's constructive position. None the less, we hope that both sides will show realism and responsibility by accepting the 10-point proposal put forward by the President of Egypt, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, we feel that proposal could create conditions for a constructive and satisfactory outcome. In the meantime, we urgently appeal for strict respect for the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, in order to protect civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories against the repression practised by the Israeli forces trying - vainly - to stifle the intifadah.\\nWe continue to be concerned by the tragedy the people of Lebanon has endured for the past 15 years. A State Member of this Organization is truly wasting away. Can we remain powerless and inactive in the face of that unacceptable situation? The international community must do everything in its power to preserve the identity, unity, territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon, and to achieve national reconciliation amongst all its sons. Niger is endeavouring to do this. We support fully the efforts made by the League of Arab States and the Tripartite Committee which it set up to find a solution to this tragedy.\\nWe are pleased to note that there has been a real abatement in the conflict between Iran and Iraq over the last year. My country again declares its support for the clear-sighted efforts made by the Secretary-General and urges the two parties to co-operate fully with him, not only to consolidate the cease-fire but also to make progress towards a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement to the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\\nRegarding Afghanistan, Niger is pleased at the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements, which made possible the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country„ We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts to facilitate a comprehensive, political settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva agreements and General Assembly resolution 43/20. The return to real peace in Afghanistan requires strict respect for the right of the Afghan people to decide independently its own fate, and requires respect for its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and of its status as a non-aligned State.\\nWe are also watching closely the development of the situation in Kampuchea, particularly the decision on the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. The International Conference held in Paris from 30 July to 3 August 1989, offers, in my delegation's view, a timely opportunity for ail the parties involved and directly concerned to find, through dialogue and reflection, a comprehensive, honourable and definitive solution to the tragedy of Cambodia.\\nEven if the results of that Conference did not measure up to the hopes we had placed in them, the Conference is certainly an important step towards a peaceful solution. The Cambodian people must be able to determine freely their own destiny without any foreign interference. Dialogue amongst all the sons of Cambodia must continue and must be intensified. In this respect Niger welcomes and encourages the commendable efforts made by the French and Indonesian Co-Chairmen.\\nThe aspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification are yet to be realized. We strongly encourage the two parties to continue the contacts and the dialogue which they have begun with a view to the reunification of Korea without foreign interference. In regard to Cyprus we are pleased with the efforts made by the Secretary-General through his Special Representative. The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island must be guaranteed and its national unity and non-aligned status must be respected.\\nConcerning Central America we are following and we welcome the praiseworthy efforts made by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to eliminate the combined impact of tension and violence and to establish the basis for true peace and co-operation. From the Contadora Agreements to those of Tesoro Beach and Tela, together with the Esquipulas II Agreements, we can gauge the determination with which the heads of State of the region are seeking means to establish a true peace. All of their initiatives and their efforts deserve the full support of this Assembly.\\nThey deserve it all the more since a terrible scourge which is afflicting all of humanity and jeopardizing the fabric of society, has over the last few months and in a brutal way, focused world attention on this region of the world. Indeed, the fight against drug trafficking in Latin America has become total war, the outcome of which will determine the capacity of the international community to display strength, determination and solidarity. This challenge involves, without any doubt, the fate and future of mankind as a whole.\\nNiger gives its support to Colombia and to all countries involved in this battle, world-wide, and urges the international community to set in motion a consistent strategy to win this struggle, which involves and challenges us all.\\nAnother problem, indeed another scourge, which is equally disturbing and whose innocent victims are increasing in numbers throughout the world, is that of international terrorism. Last year. Pan Am flight 103, from London to New York, crashed in Scotland, with several hundreds of victims, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia. On behalf of Niger, we pay a tribute once again to his memory. A few months ago Colonel Higgins, a man working for peace, was assassinated in cold blood. Recently, an aircraft of the UTA company, on a flight between Brazzaville and Paris, exploded in mid-air over territory of my country, killing 171 innocent victims. These are only a few examples, but unfortunately there are many others. On behalf of President Ali Saibou and the people of Niger, I express here to all the States whose nationals perished in the tragedy of this UTA flight our deep sympathy and our sincere condolences.\\nTerrorism is the evil of our century. It strikes out blindly and indiscriminately. He must launch a real, unified crusade, a sacred union even, to combat terrorism, which today transcends national borders and political and ideological differences. Niger and its government are determined to make their contribution, however modest, to the struggle, which affects us all.\\nThe present climate of detente, which has prevailed for at least a year in international relations, should encourage the world to reflect further on the ways\\nand means of restoring peace wherever it has been disturbed, to preserve it everywhere it is threatened, and to strengthen it wherever it has been established.\\nThe period of calm in the political arena is contrasted, however, very sharply with the world economic situation characterized, unfortunately, by a profound structural imbalance. In fact, unequal development between North and South is the main contradiction in the world today. It is clear however that peace and security are directly linked with development. Thus the climate of detente which prevails at this time in the world would be vain and have no future if the developing countries continue to have to deal with difficulties which are constantly aggravated through imbalance, inequality and flagrant injustice in their economic relations with the industrialized countries.\\nThe gap between developed countries and developing countries is widening day by day. Whereas in the North there is talk of growth and expansion, in the South the talk is still about food self-sufficiency and structural adjustment. Men, women and children of Africa, of Asia, and of Latin America and the Caribbean, are living through the tragedy of hunger, poverty, illiteracy, natural disasters such as drought, desertification, plaques of locusts, cyclones, and so on. Societies that are just surviving, societies that are overwhelmed: that is the harsh reality of developing countries, of which, sadly, Africa has the greatest number.\\nThe causes of this trend are to be found essentially in the collapse in commodity prices, the deterioration in terms of trade and the crushing weight of external debt. These phenomena, which have led to a net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries, and the multilateral financial institutions, are stripping States in the South of every chance of development, thus making them incapable of creating the investments necessary for real and lasting growth.\\nGiven this situation, our Governments have undertaken profound economic reforms. These reforms, carried out at great social and political cost, have not enjoyed, as was hoped and promised, the full support of the international community. Less than two years from the time it was, theoretically, to come to an end, the five-year United Nations programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has still not really started.\\nAs the Secretary-General stressed in his annual report on the work of the organization, failure to find a solution could lead to a collapse of the social and political structures in many developing countries.\\nWhatever the case, it is urgently necessary that particular attention be given to the most vulnerable countries: the least developed countries, countries affected by drought and desertification, countries suffering from natural scourges and countries suffering from being land-locked, for whom a revival of economic and social development is a necessity.\\nFirst, new and lasting solutions to the problem o£ debt must be found through continuing consideration by and co-operation between creditor and debtor countries in all appropriate forums. In this regard, Niger welcomes the plans and initiatives so far put forward and supports the idea of an international conference on Africa's external debt, as advocated by the organization of African Unity. We welcome the decisions first of Canada, in 1987, and then of France this year, followed by those of Belgium and Italy, to cancel all debt relating to development assistance. Niger hopes - and this is our interest in an international conference on the debt - that those unilateral actions will be followed by collective measures, the fruit of a general and formal agreement between debtor countries and their creditor partners, both bilateral and multilateral.\\nSecondly, we must make a methodical and determined search for a new, more just and balanced international economic order in which economic and social security is guaranteed to all peoples. That new international economic order can be sought and achieved only within the framework of the North-South dialogue, which must be resumed.\\nIn the same context we welcome and firmly support the proposal made in July 1989 by the Presidents of Egypt, Senegal and Venezuela and the Prime Minister of India concerning the organization of regular summit consultations between North and South on problems of common interest to the two hemispheres.\\nIn this connection, the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular the revitalisation of economic growth and development in developing countries, to be held in April 1990, will constitute, we believe, a propitious occasion and an appropriate framework for the reinvigoration of the North-South dialogue. This applies also to the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Paris in 1990.\\nWe cherish the hope that these conferences and initiatives will contribute to the effective resumption of the North-South dialogue by offering the possibility of achieving an agreement on the nature of the problems facing developing countries and the approach to be taken towards solving them. Niger intends to participate actively and to make its contribution through concrete proposals that could lead to the emergence of a new era of healthy co-operation between North and South.\\nMoreover, we are particularly interested in the current negotiations on the new Lome convention, which in our view should serve as a model both as regards efforts to stabilize the export earnings of developing countries, assistance in the diversification of their exports and the opening of markets to their products, and as regards development assistance.\\n1 should like to conclude this section by expressing a concern that is widely shared by the countries represented here. I refer to the problem of children.\\nThe difficult economic situation in developing countries is the reason for the situation of children in those countries, and particularly in Africa being so worrying, despite the importance and priority which our Governments accord to the protection and well-being of children, since they represent the future.\\nThe results of efforts made by members of the international community, with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international organizations, to ensure the survival, protection and full development of the potential of children are encouraging. It is essential, however, to pursue and intensify our efforts collectively. That is why Niger firmly supports not only the idea of convening with urgency a world summit devoted to children, but also the conclusion and adoption as a top priority by the General Assembly at the present session of a draft convention on the rights of the child. The environment crisis, which is felt throughout the world and seriously threatens life on our planet, is a question to which the international community should pay urgent attention. Today, the degradation of the ozone layer, the heating of the atmosphere and climatic changes are as much a reality as deforestation, desertification of arable lands, pollution of water and the atmosphere, the disappearance of fauna and flora, toxic wastes, and the transfer of hazardous wastes to developing countries.\\nThe means of avoiding ecological disaster exist. We must use the available technology, improve it, and share it. To this end, it is imperative that Member States draw up co-ordinated plans of action to resolve the environmental crisis. That is a joint responsibility that calls for solidarity and it must be said that it is the duty of the industrialized countries to prevent or limit the damage caused to the world environment and to help our developing countries to achieve healthy development.\\nThe United Nations conference on environment and development proposed for 1992 will provide an excellent opportunity to work out agreed action at the world level and to define new principles of international law concerning the protection and conservation of the environment and, in particular, effective international measures to prohibit the transfer of hazardous wastes to the territories of other countries.\\nAs everybody knows and as is true of many African countries, the economic and social situation is the main and constant source of concern for the Government of Niger. Nevertheless, I am happy to inform the Assembly that President Ali Saibou has undertaken action aimed at the political evolution of our country with the ultimate objective of a return to constitutional life. Following the adoption by referendum of the National Charter in July 1987, the process of setting up apolitical system as the basis for the Second Republic of Niger entered its final, decisive phase with the establishment, in May 1989, of the National Movement for the Society in Development and the adoption by referendum on 24 September of a new Constitution.\\nAs the President, General Ali Saibou, said, the National Movement for the Society in Development will be the appropriate forum for political expression in which the women and men of Niger will strive to affirm and defend their political, economic and social rights. The goal is the realization of participatory democracy guaranteeing the free expression of ideological opinions and sentiments, in order to achieve a constructive political awareness and the consolidation of a stable and integrated regime involving all the components of our nation.\\nThe Constitution reaffirms the law character and republican nature of the State and makes Niger a State of law that respects the fundamental freedoms of individuals. It ensures the equality of all before the law and enshrines the principle of the sovereignty of the people.\\nIn that Constitution the people of Niger reaffirms its will to co-operate in friendship with all peoples that cherish peace, justice and freedom. It reiterates its total and permanent readiness to seek, with all the nations of the world, solutions to the innumerable ills that afflict the international community and to construct a world of peace, justice and progress in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\\nLegislative and presidential elections will take place on 10 December next, with direct universal suffrage, and will complete the process of a return to normal constitutional life in Niger.\\nThat is my delegation's contribution to the general debate at the forty-fourth session, which we wish the most outstanding success. We hope that it will  strengthen the unshakable faith of our Governments in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. We hope that it will instil in each of our peoples a planetary patriotism thanks to which we shall be able to succeed in our. undertaking and build slowly but surely a single, indivisible world of peace, happiness and human dignity.  \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>﻿\\nDuring the debate at the fortieth session of the General Assembly four years ago, President Sanguinetti announced to the world community from this very rostrum that Uruguay had resumed its traditional path of political democracy, and was determined to respect and to enforce respect domestically for all human rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic, and further announced his firm resolve to resume active participation on the global stage of international relations in the pursuit of peace, universal respect for human rights and the equality of all nations, based on respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\\nSix months prior to the conclusion of President Sanguinetti's constitutional term, I have the honour to mount the same rostrum to announce to this international community that today those intentions have been fully realized.\\nIndeed, within a few weeks, elections will be held in Uruguay to elect all the authorities who will be responsible for the destiny of the country for the next five years. This fact, commonplace in the political tradition of a democratic country, is particularly significant in out case, since it represents the culmination of a period of democratic recovery during which full respect for the Constitution has been restored? all individual rights have been scrupulously observed, and national reconciliation has been achieved, inter alia by a general amnesty ratified by popular mandate. Law and justice have been restored, and the country has been rescued from a declining economic situation through the vigorous revitalization of the external sector and the application of stabilizing policies which have allowed reasonable product growth, a decrease in unemployment and an increase in real earnings.\\nOn the international front, Uruguay has honoured all its commitments, including those of a financial nature which entailed - then and today - considerable sacrifices. It has actively contributed, at times beyond the power of its political weight and its material resources, to efforts aimed at reinforcing international peace, security and co-operation. It has embarked upon a firm policy of regional and sub regional integration and participates actively with other democracies in the hemisphere to co-ordinate positions in order to satisfy our common interests. In short, the Government of Uruguay is acting on the international scene, secure in the moral and political authority it derives from the right to represent a free, democratic, stable and peace-loving society. This task of democratic consolidation has been successful but also extremely difficult. As President Sanguinetti said to this Assembly in 1985:\\n'Democracy is a fragile flower; ... it only grows aid survives in the right soil and the right climate. A genuine democracy based on respect for the individual and an the periodical, free advice of the people can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. ... When this condition is not fulfilled, and poverty and unemployment prevail, violence emerges and is unleashed, the powers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil, the fabric of society disintegrates and, in the international sphere, political loyalties become erratic.' (A/40/PV.6, p. 12)\\nIndeed, democracy is never limited to a purely political dimension, nor is it a sufficient condition to ensure freedom for all the people.\\nThe economic and social component of a democratic society is what ultimately determines its feasibility aid stability. It is for this reason that the question posed by the foreign Ministers of the Group of 8 when considering the problem of foreign debt is a valid one today: How much poverty can freedom withstand?\\nLike democracy in other Latin American countries and other regions of the world, democracy in Uruguay has been constantly threatened by a severe economic crisis unprecedented in its history.\\nWe are aware - and this is always worth repeating - of our share of responsibility in the task of overcoming the crisis and promoting development and economic growth. We know that that is possible only through our own efforts, through the formulation and application of our own policies and, particularly, through our own sacrifices. But we are also aware that, despite the social and political cost of these adjustment processes, the expected benefits will not be obtained without greater participation and commitment by the industrialized countries, particularly in the areas of international finance and trade.\\nThe issue of underdevelopment, therefore, remains the major world problem faced by mankind. The growth achieved by a few Asian countries cannot hide the fact that there has been significant regression in the social indicators of many countries in Latin America and Africa. That bears eloquent testimony to the seriousness of the situation and the political risk to their governing institutions, and consequently to world peace.\\nThe vast foreign debt which weighs so heavily on many of our countries has reversed the flow of financial resources, which now runs from South to North. The task of turning the tide cannot be delayed, since this debt is paralysing all our efforts to achieve economic development and democratic stability.\\nIt is encouraging to note that creditor countries have new accepted the principle of shared responsibility in the foreign-debt problem, and have agreed that this problem is not simply financial but also political and social. It is also noteworthy and encouraging that creditor Governments appear willing to consider formulas to help the constrained economies of debtor nations.\\nIn this respect, the agreement between Mexico and its international bank creditors has set a precedent regarding the feasibility of the Brady philosophy and has aroused legitimate hopes and expectations in the rest of the debtor nations.\\nWithout a pragmatic approach to the debt problem there will be no development and no economic growth; without these prerequisites it will be very difficult to continue to believe in democracy, and without democracy world stability and peace will be very hard to maintain.\\nWhat we need today is a revolutionary change in our ideas and policies with respect to international economics, ultimately leading to the formulation of a new development strategy. The starting point of that strategy should be recognition of the interdependence of all States, whatever their size or economic or military power; and the objective should be to ensure that this interdependence is viewed as guaranteeing greater predictability and stability in world trade and economic relations and a more just distribution of the benefits.\\nThis new international strategy for development should be dynamic, flexible and, above all, concrete and precise in the formulation of measures designed to fight poverty, to eliminate protectionism and discrimination in international trade, and to facilitate access by all developing countries to technology and to the financial and economic markets of industrialized nations.\\nThe environmental dimension should be an essential ingredient in the new international development strategy. The deterioration of the environment has become a matter of concern to the entire international community and there is no doubt it will continue to be a matter of concern in the years to come.\\nThere can be no doubt that the environment must, be protected and that each State must assume responsibility and take action in this respect for its own well-being and for that of other peoples of the world. But it is also true that\\nthe correct solution to the problem requires sincere and broad international co-operation to ensure that the cost of protecting the environment is not borne by only a few countries which ate still struggling for full development of their un-exploited natural resources. In no case - and this is more important still - should protection of the environment become a new form of conditionality to which the sovereign decisions of countries still requiring international co-operation for their development would be subordinated.\\nIn summary, Uruguay is conscious of the urgent need to protect the environment-, but we are also aware that this is a task requiring the participation and efforts of the entire international community and that it should be carried out in a way compatible with the national sovereignty of all nations.\\nHowever, the implementation of a development policy that guarantees both the protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources requires the provision of financial resources and appropriate technologies not available to all the countries in the world.\\nAs we stated last year and repeat today: the technological dependence of the developing countries is not only a factor inhibiting their economic development, but also as a serious threat to their political sovereignty as that posed by foreign aggression.\\nThe cost of transferring financial and technological resources to developing countries represents barely a marginal fraction of the funds used by the super-Powers in the arms race, for which they invoke reasons of national security. They forget that reasons of national survival would make it mandatory for them to allocate more than a marginal fraction of that overall expenditure to the transfer of resources and technology to developing countries, thereby facilitating their\\nparticipation in the common task of protecting both world peace and the quality of the environment.\\nIn dealing with the question of the environment, the international community must resort to the basic mechanism of co-operation between nations because we are faced with a common danger, affecting us all, and there is no political system or degree of development or military Power than can give any State the slightest immunity against it.\\nUnfortunately, it is not only dangers to the environment that indiscriminately affect all nations and peoples. There are other reasons forcing us to resort to and develop the mechanisms of global solidarity and co-operation. Terrorism and drug trafficking, which at times appear to be complementary phenomena, continue to wreak destruction and havoc, despite the universal revulsion they arouse.\\nUruguay unequivocally condemns terrorism. For us, any terrorist act is inhuman and cruel, violates the most sacred human rights and reveals the basest and most destructive feelings of men. There is no purpose, no cause, no issue, however noble, that can justify the commission of a terrorist act. For that reason, Uruguay will contribute, without qualifications based on motives or purposes, to efforts directed at establishing new legal measures and at strengthening existing ones providing for the eradication of this scourge from the face of the earth.\\nWith respect to drug trafficking, we are concerned at the rate at which it has expanded and at the vast power behind it, but at the same time we are encouraged to see that the governments of consumer nations have become aware of their responsibilities and that producer nations have shouldered the risks involved in an open war against drug traffickers. In this connection, it is my duty, and my pleasure, to express to the Government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas and to the people of Colombia the solidarity of the Government of Uruguay in respect of recent events in our sister Republic, and our admiration for the courage with which Colombians are tackling this problem.\\nThe political climate that now prevails is perhaps the most propitious in four decades for the successful initiation and implementation of undertakings necessitating the willingness of Governments to co-operate with each other. Ideological dogmatism and political inflexibility appear to be losing ground in the face of realism and common sense. Over the last few months, we have embarked on a new era of dialogue and collaboration, which has translated into a cessation of hostilities, the reaching of agreements, and the establishment of contacts and channels of communication. All of this has led to the solution, or imminent solution, of several regional conflicts.\\nThe cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq; the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan that has already taken place; the recent efforts to normalize the situation in Kampuchea; the December 1988 agreements on southern Africa and the beginning of the self-determination process in Namibia; the agreements on New Caledonia; the contacts concerning Western Sahara; the new surge in the Central American peace process following the regional presidential summit last August; and the promising resumption of dialogue between Argentina and the United Kingdom with a view to settling their differences directly - these are manifestations of this desire for peace, and proof of the sterility and futility of confrontation, intolerance and misguided nationalism.\\n\\nThis new spirit is evident also in the changes introduced by numerous countries in the principles and objectives of their domestic policies, which have led them to greater openness, both internally and externally, thereby strengthening the prospects for international peace and co-operation. 1 am referring to political evolution on the domestic front in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, as well as to the steps taken towards democracy by the last authoritarian regimes in South America, which are evidence of a less dogmatic political vision that, fortunately, appears to be spreading in almost all regions of the world.\\nHowever, there remain areas in which the voices of peace go unheeded, First, the human-rights situation in the world is still far from satisfactory. The international community knows that the important progress made in the political field will remain precarious while vast sectors of the world's peoples are unable fully to enjoy their human rights.\\nThere can be no doubt whatsoever that no progress - whether economic, social, political or moral — will have a firm foundation so long as any vestiges of racism and racial discrimination remain, and in particular while practices such as apartheid continue. South Africa's persistence in disregarding the resolutions of the United Nations will not stifle the persistence of the rest of the world in reclaiming for that country the full force of the equality and dignity of the human race.\\nThe work of the United Nations in developing human rights and establishing the means of guaranteeing respect for them must continue, with the support of the international community. A very important step has been taken with the drafting of the convention on the rights of the child, which we trust will soon become, for every State, the appropriate ethical and legal framework for improving the status of children.\\nThe Middle East conflict continues to threaten world peace and to cost the parties involved a high price in human life and in moral and material damage. Nevertheless, signals are beginning to come from both sides - signals that are helping to generate the climate necessary for a negotiated solution. For Israel, this would mean lasting peace within safe borders, and, for the Palestinians, the possibility of exercising freely their right to self-determination.\\nIn this region, we are also particularly concerned about the tragic situation in Lebanon - a country with which we have many links, and whose long-suffering people are the victims of an unjust and senseless war, with the Resulting death and devastation with which we are all too familiar.\\nUruguay has raised its voice in the past, and does so again, to call on all the parties involved to intensify their efforts to achieve a final solution to the conflict. This implies the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese territory and the harmonization, by democratic means, of domestic differences. In this regard, we wish every success for the mediation undertaken by several heads of State of the League of Arab States. We trust that the pursuit of peace in Lebanon will succeed and that this country will once again be as prosperous and peaceful as it once was.\\nThese problems, as well as other situations that threaten peace, are this year, as in previous years, difficult challenges to which the General Assembly should respond by trying to reconcile the specific interests of each nation with\\nthe general interests of the international community. We are aware that this is a task fraught with difficulties, but at the same time we are encouraged because we know, Mr. President, that under your enlightened and expert direction, we shall achieve the desired results.\\nI should like to conclude by expressing our sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his intelligent and effective presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session, and also to the Secretary-General, whose dynamism, tact and commitment have strengthened the role of his office within the Organization and have been an essential factor in enhancing its prestige through his successful intervention in the peaceful solution of a number of regional conflicts.\\n</td>\n",

The unanimity of that decision reflects not only your own distinguished record as Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative of your country to the United Nations but also the prestige of your country, Nigeria, of which all of us in Africa are proud.\\nThe outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, shouldered the responsibility of his office with distinction in a momentous and difficult year. We wish to acknowledge our debt to him.\\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, has been at the head of our Organization during some of its roost troubled and also some of its most productive and successful years. The turnaround in the fortunes of the United Nations during his watch owes much to the skill of the helmsman and we want to reassure him of our continued confidence.\\nThe current session of the General Assembly must seriously address itself to problems affecting the world economy. In the vital field of international economic relations, the fresh breeze that has led to such excitement in international political relations has not even made a ripple. The direction of the world economy is still determined by a small circle of rich and powerful nations for which short-term expediency and the requirements of individual national economies have all too often taken precedence over the steps required for a healthier world economy from which all States would benefit in the long run. For the smaller countries the result has been a collapse in commodity prices causing severe prejudicial terms of trade, where several times the volume and quality of produce is now required to purchase the same amount of manufactured goods from the North than was required only a few years ago. In addition, the necessary borrowing on the part of the developing countries, coupled with high interest rates, has resulted in a debilitating debt-service burden for those countries that has culminated in a net reverse transfer of resources from South to North in the order of nearly $50 billion annually according to the calculations of international financial institutions. Fifty billion dollars annually is a very big amount to owe and we ate informed that more money is still continuing to flow from the developing countries to the developed countries. \\nHow can we, in all conscience, talk of kinder, gentler times and continue to countenance the continual transfer of such a phenomenal amount of resources from the poor and the hungry to the rich and the affluent? We welcome the positive developments on the international political stage and we believe that all peoples should enjoy political and civil rights. Conscience, however, enjoins us to submit that these rights are not enough. People have economic and social rights as well: the right to good health, the right to food and shelter, and above all the tight to a decent standard of living. It should be the lot of no one to suffer the degradations of illiteracy and poverty. Hunan rights are a package the elements of which are mutually reinforcing, and the denial of any of them weakens the entire package. A poor man, a sick man and an illiterate man are just as manacled as the man who is denied individual freedom or the right of free speech. It is the package that is important, for it goes beyond the selective, and at times cynical, championing of this or that right to the core of the purpose of existence·, the tight to a decent and meaningful life. Any attempt to separate one from the other or to compartmentalize these rights and champion one right at the expense of the other is to sow confusion and set the stage for futile recriminations.\\nAll States represented in the Assembly should subscribe to that view and attempt to pursue the objective of a good and decent existence for all human beings. The pursuit of a healthier world economy, of growth and development of the poorer countries and of fairer terms of trade between the North and the South is fundamentally a struggle for human rights and for the tight of people to a decent existence.\\nIn our interdependent world that struggle must involve a concerted approach, including greater recourse to multilateral mechanisms on the part of all States. Nations must act together to solve the global and interrelated problems of the world economy, as low commodity prices, high interest rates and acute external Indebtedness. The politics of inclusion that appear to be gaining ground in international political relations, particularly through professions by the big Powers of their readiness to give a larger role in the management of international affairs to the United Nations, should also be reflected in international economic relations.\\nThe initiative taken by the developing countries in urging the Assembly to hold a special session on economic co-operation, in particular for the revitalization of the growth and development of developing countries, in April 1990, is a timely development. The special session should focus on the need to renew the stalled North-South dialogue and on the direction of the world economy. I am pleased to note that the recent summit Conference of the Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, held at Belgrade, endorsed this suggestion and all the member States of the Non-Aligned Movement will be co-operating in the exercise. In this era, when economic mega-blocs are in the process of being formed in North America and in Europe, and where East and West are drawing closer in many spheres, it is essential that developing countries are not left out of the discussions and the mechanisms that will affect the future course of international economic and political relations. We also note that preparations are under way for the elaboration of the international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. We wish to stress the complementarity we see between that process and next year's special session on economic co-operation, to which I have already referred.\\nFollowing the 1986 special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa, the Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. That Programme represented a compact between the African countries and the international community, especially the donor countries. The African countries were to take steps to redress their economies through structural adjustment programmes, which they have done - often at a significant social and political cost - and the international community undertook to create an international environment conducive to African recovery by facilitating an increase in commodity prices and resource 21ows to the continent. The mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme, annexed to resolution 43/27 of 1988, clearly states that the international community has not kept its side of the bargain. The African States have made the adjustments that were required of them. Let me echo the words of Mr. Michael Manley, Prime Minister of Jamaica, when he sand recently: ,We have done everything that was asked of us. But what has the other side done?, \\nCommodity prices have continued to fall and resource flows to Africa have not increased in any appreciable way. Given the sacrifices the African countries have made to keep their part of the bargain, it is important that the Programme be made o work. Since the review of the Programme will take place in 1991, and the programme itself is to run only up to 1990, it is important that the Programme be mandated to run until the final review, and we hope that decision will be taken at this session. \\nProblems of the environment affect the entire globe, which is our common abode, and many speakers have referred to this important factor. From the depletion of the ozone layer to the poisoning of the atmosphere and the rivers, the degradation of the environment affects all of us. The global warming of the general climate affects com tries in Europe, in the Americas, Africa and everywhere. For us in Africa the problem of the environment is important as we face what one representative has described here as the encroaching deserts. We have heard from many delegations of the encroachment of the desert on to their own fertile lands. We also have the related problem of the dumping of nuclear and toxic wastes which have been the subject of resolutions by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the International Atomic Energy Agency and the General Assembly itself, last year. Greater responsibility is needed in the way the world uses its natural resources and disposes of the dangerous waste products of its factories. In the last year representatives will have read press reports about the very dangerous dumping of wastes in certain African countries, which action was rightly condemned by the OAU and other internal forums. We therefore welcome the intention to hold a special international conference on the environment in 1992. \\nWe are also aware that all too often the weak ate made to pay for the sins of the strong - if only because controlling the strong is so much more difficult. It is important that the burden attendant upon safeguarding the environment should be shared judiciously according to resource usage, waste production and need. Particularly, it is essential that no new obstacles are put in the path of the economic progress of the developing countries, which are already at the receiving end of the imbalances and inequities of the present international economic order and of the abuse and misuse of the international environment. \\nRespect for the right of peoples to self-determination and independence is not only just? it is also good politics and essential to the attainment and maintenance of world peace. The General Assembly clearly recognized that fact when it adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples way back in December 1960. Yet today, nearly three decades later, colonialism is still very much in evidence. Again, that is a practical reality of our times. The right of peoples to decide their own destiny is being denied not only in the well-publicized cases of southern Africa and the Middle East, especially Palestine, but also in countries in the Pacific, the Caribbean basin and elsewhere. \\nHowever, the major issue facing the Organization this year is the decolonization of Namibia. That is as it should be. The birth of a new nation is a supreme event in international affairs. And when the United Nations is the appointed intermediary the event becomes even more special to all of us. We ate now entering the horns stretch in the implementation of the Namibian independence plan. Much ground has already been covered and much reference has been made to this phenomenon in speeches we have heard in the last two weeks. But a lot more still remains to be done in the remaining four-and-a-half weeks. Pretoria and its functionaries in Namibia are still refusing fully to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the South West Africa Territory (SWATP) command structure has not been disbanded, end we are told that it has only been stood down  the so-called disbandment of Koevoet on 30 September has proved to be illusory  restrictive laws, in particular AG-23, continue to inhibit freedom of assembly and the registration, electoral and constituent Assembly proclamations leave much to be desired. These proclamations were affected only last week, end more information is still being given as to what exactly has been agreed to. Some improvements have been made, some changes have been recorded, and we commend the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) for this, but we need to be vigilant and to ensure that in the next four-and-a-half weeks nothing will be done to reverse the clock. Intimidation of followers of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) by the South-African-sponsored Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) end the South West African Police is regularly reported. In fact, if members read Namibian newspapers they will find they ate full of reports of attacks on SWAPO men and supporters, at times with the police just standing by. UNTAG police units are stretched to the breaking-point we are told, and the assassination of SWAPO leaders has actually taken place.\\nSo, while we ate on the home stretch, a grave situation still surrounds events in Namibia, and it is important that we should all keep our guard and remain vigilant. As we enter these final weeks of the election campaign the desperation of the anti-SWAPO forces in Namibia is becoming evident daily. It is important, therefore, that urgent action be taken to strengthen UNTAG police units and to increase the number of projected electoral monitors. We are very pleased that a number of States represented here have agreed and are going to send observers, monitors and guests to Namibia over the next few weeks to observe what will be happening. The more observers, the more guests, the more people we can have in that country, the better. We welcome the effort being made by many States around the globe.\\nMeanwhile, the United Nations must prepare well-thought-out plans for the post-election period in Namibia, assuming the election proceeds satisfactorily. For there can be no doubt that, as the decolonizing authority, the United Nations has a continuing responsibility to see that Namibia's independence is a success. A good mother does not give birth only to abandon the baby immediately. This session of the General Assembly must ensure that the United Nations prepares itself to be a good mother. My delegation is ready to contribute in the process of clarifying the united Nations role during the transition period following the elections and in the elaboration of a continuing United Nations responsibility to ensure that Namibian independence is a success. These are urgent tasks which require our immediate attention. Every effort has been made to draw the attention of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the United Nations generally to these natters, especially the question of convening the Assembly after the elections. Whoever wins the election, it is not yet clear how the Assembly will be convened and how it will proceed to draw up the constitution leading to independence. We would be pleased if the United Nations would remain seized of these problems and would continue to provide solutions until the time of independence itself.\\nIn South Africa itself, apartheid, the root cause of all the problems in southern Africa, continues to be firmly entrenched. The state of emergency still continues  Mandela and other political prisoners remain incarcerated j liberation and mass democratic movements ant still proscribed·, the Group Areas Pet and other obnoxious legislative acts continue to be on the apartheid statute books. That is the reality of the situation in South Africa itself.\\nPresident de Klerk's talk of reform so far remains only mere talk. It is important that the Pretoria regime be urged to go beyond rhetoric to concrete action. The liberation movements are ready to engage President de Klerk in serious negotiations. They have formulated an imaginative negotiating platform which was adopted by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, in Harare, on 21 August 1989, as well as by the ninth non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade, It is on the table for South Africa to take advantage of. This is an olive branch from the liberation movement. It outlines a number of confidence-building measures needed before negotiations can begin and sets out the fundamental human rights that should guide the formulation of a new constitutional dispensation for a future South Africa. It is quite obvious of course that negotiations, or any form of dialogue, cannot take place while the leaders are incarcerated in gaols or while the present restrictions emanating from the state of emergency remain. The international community has warmly welcomed this important initiative for peace to which I have just referred, taken by the liberation movement. So far Pretoria has remained mum on this proposal. We are told that certain of the seven leaders who are now incarcerated nay be released sooner or later. That might be a palliative, but what we need is a complete and full constitutional dispensation that can being peaceful conditions in which negotiations can truly take place for the future of an independent South Africa.\\nUntil Pretoria dismantles apartheid it is important that the international community intensifies its pressure on it and increases the sanctions against it. There is no secret about the fact that Pretoria is now talking reform is directly related to the impact of international sanctions and the pressure exerted by the liberation forces and other democratic forces in South Africa. There is no doubt whatsoever that sanctions are working and can continue to work. They have damaged the South African economy to a great extent, as has been admitted by the economic spokesmen for that regime. Therefore, more sanctions will certainly put more pressure on the regime. The medicine is slowly taking effect. We appeal to those friends of Pretoria who oppose sanctions to join the rest of the international community in bringing meaningful pressure to bear on Pretoria by applying sanctions and supporting the liberation movement.\\nTo the international banking community we say that 1990 will be a critical year for the apartheid regime, because in that year it has to reschedule its debt. Rescheduling the debt is not an automatic right for the racist regime let it be a favour, granted as an inducement to meaningful change in South Africa. The concatenation of events makes the coming rescheduling exercise a particularly potent force for positive political developments in South Africa. We urge the bankers to use it. We have given them adequate information to ensure that they ace quite clear about the choices before then.  \\nElsewhere in southern Africa, there are regional efforts to bring peace to Angola and to Mozambique. The Assembly has heard statements by the Foreign Ministers of both those countries, elaborating on those measures. We in Zimbabwe appeal to outsiders to stop supporting rebel elements in Mozambique and Angola, especially UNITA in Angola, which has created difficulties in the process of reconciliation. We are seeking African solutions to African problems. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations can help as requested and as required, but we ask them to give these initiatives a chance.\\nWe also seek peace efforts in the dispute between Mauritania and Senegal, the situation in the Sudan and the situation in Ethiopia. African solutions, initiated by the OAU, are at work in those situations, and we again appeal to outsiders not to interfere in the processes of reconciliation that ate taking place. We are satisfied that the initiatives taken by the Organization of African Unity, if given time to mature, will provide solutions and bring peace to the three areas I have mentioned.\\nWe are also anxious to see Western Sahara's independence consolidated with speed and firmness. The Secretary-General's efforts to bring permanent peace to Western Sahara are commended. We also commend the meetings that took place earlier this year between the King of Morocco and the POLISARID Front. We hope these efforts will continue.\\nThe denial of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination is a continuing sore in international relations. We deplore the heavy-handed methods of the occupation forces against the aggrieved heroic Palestinian nation. We wish to reiterate our conviction that only an international peace conference under United Nations auspices, with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as an equal partner are addressing all aspects of the Middle East crisis, can bring peace to the region. The proclamation of a Palestinian State last year was an important development in this area. We commended, and commend, the PIO for the step it took, and we are pleased that over 85 countries have recognized the Palestinian State. From that strong position, the Palestinian leadership should be able to proceed to meaningful negotiations with big Powers, small Powers and others in the region that are seized of the problem of Palestine. The independence of Palestine has been long delayed, and we should like to see the Palestinian people take their place as equal citizens alongside the peoples of other nations.\\nIn Central America, we welcome the decision to disband the contras and the scheduled elections in Nicaragua, which are to be monitored by the Organization of American States, the United Nations and a host of other international observers. We are pleased that a dialogue has resumed between the Salvadorian Government and the Marti National Liberation Front aimed at bringing peace to El Salvador. We urge flexibility on both sides so that a peaceful solution can be found to their conflict. The only warning we as outsiders would issue regarding the Central American situation again takes the form of urging outsiders not to interfere in the processes that are taking place there. The effort being made by the leaders of Central America to corns together and produce plans that enable them to enjoy self-determination and full human rights and provide peace for their own territories is commendable - if only outsiders do not interfere. In that respect, the main instigator of problems that have arisen in Central America is, of course, the United States, which has continued to fail in troubled waters in Latin America. \\nIn Afghanistan, we again urge all outside Powers to stop supplying arms to the opposing sides, and we call upon the Afghan people to negotiate an end to their civil war in a spirit of national reconciliation. We are pleased to note the departure of Soviet troops, and we are also pleased to note the confidence and patriotism that act brought to the Afghan people themselves. We hope that sooner or later they will convene a shura - an assembly - that will make it possible for all Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan to get together to resolve their problems. We believe all Afghans can solve their problems in peace in a shura, their traditional assembly which had met periodically over the past 300 or 400 years.\\nOn the question of Kampuchea, we welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and urge the parties concerned to negotiate their differences among themselves in order to arrive at an acceptable solution. We noted with disappointment the failure of the recent Paris Conference. We also noted with disappointment that both the Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh delegations to that Conference refused to accept the international mechanism that was suggested a United Nations peace-keeping force. We have made it clear to them, and we make it clear now, that we do not see any possibility of disarming the rival forces, bringing peace to Cambodia and holding elections there without the active participation of the United Nations. The United Nations has much experience with peace-keeping forces around the world, and, in our view, is the only organization that can assist in the peace-making and peace-keeping process. \\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula, it is our view that the Korean people should be left alone to negotiate their reunification without outside interference. We urge that the military manoeuvres by outside forces that often take place on the peninsula or in waters near it be stopped.\\nWith regard to Cyprus we appeal again to both parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the search for a lasting solution. We commend the meetings that have taken place under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General between the President of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish Cypriots. Again, we call on outside Powers to cease interfering in the internal affairs of Cyprus.\\nIn Belgrade the leaders of the non-aligned countries called for self-determination for the remaining colonies of New Caledonia, Malvinas, Diego Garcia, Mayotte and a dozen other territories scattered across the globe. The forty-third session of the General Assembly declared an International Decade for the eradication of the retrograde system of colonialism. We repeat that call from this rostrum.\\nAs can be seen from the problems I have just touched upon, we have not yet readied the Promised Land, the new detente notwithstanding. Much remains to be done, and in that the United Nations must play a central role. We therefore welcome the declarations that have be τ made from this podium by the great Powers, renewing their faith in the United Nations. These days of change also mean a period of uncertainty, a period of opportunities, yet also of danger. In such a period, recourse to and respect for the Organization and its agencies becomes more indispensable than ever before.\\nIt was in recognition of that fact, and motivated by the desire to strengthen peace and the rule of law, as well as to bring the age of reason to international relations, that the non-aligned countries convened at The Hague, from 26 to 30 June 1989 a Conference on Pace and the Rule of law in International Affairs. We were pleased by the wide attendance at that Conference, which included important countries not members of our Movement. The Conference was a landmark in the struggle to bring the rule of law and the role of the World Court to the centrality they should enjoy in the resolution of conflicts and in the management of international relations. An important initiative was taken at the Conference to have the General Assembly declare at its current session a decade of international law from 1990 to 1999, leading to a third Hague Peace Conference. That is one of the concrete acts that can be achieved at this session of the General Assembly in the cause of peace, justice and the rule of law. We urge all Member States to support that noble initiative by the non-aligned countries. I am informed that a concrete proposal has already been submitted to the Sixth Committee and that it is now being debated.\\nLast - but by no means least - is the all-important issue of nuclear disarmament, to which I have not referred extensively in my statement. We have all had the opportunity to welcome the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in 1987. That was a truly significant step in the right direction, but what remains to be achieved is even more formidable. In comparison to that, the INF Treaty is indeed only the tip of the iceberg. The super-Powers have a special responsibility in this regard. As the possessors of the largest arsenals of nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction, they have a duty to take the lead in the disarmament process.\\nBut of course we of the non-aligned movement, as well as the Organization of African Unity, can take some credit for the fact that at the special session of the General Assembly convened last year to discuss the question of disarmament we made our position abundantly clear. We indicated the hazards of war with which the road to disarmament is replete, and we are pleased that our call has been heeded in some quarters.\\nToday the world still has many problems, but in 1989 there is a window of opportunity to address some of them. History will judge us harshly if we miss that opportunity.\\n</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ﻿It is indeed a pleasure for me and the members of my delegation to extend to Ambassador Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities and experience. I am fully confident that under his able and wise leadership the Assembly will further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.\\nMy delegation associates itself with previous speakers in expressing its appreciation of the dedicated efforts of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo, for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.\\nAs in previous years, my delegation wishes to note its satisfaction with and gratitude for the assiduous and unrelenting efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the cause of peace and international harmony. We pay a tribute to him for his untiring efforts to promote conditions conducive to the realization of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, we praise and congratulate him on the successes the Organization has achieved in recent years. More particularly we praise him for the renewed faith and regeneration of confidence in the Organization and its ability to Play an instrumental role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  \\nToday we find ourselves at an important crossroads. Recent years have witnessed a welcome positive change in the international political climate. The confrontational tone evident in super-Power relations not too long ago continues to show signs of thawing. At the same time,, a number of regional and sub regional conflicts have taken momentous strides towards resolution. Many more protracted conflicts show signs of hope and movement. Though one might argue that the present situation continues to be delicate, the process made can hardly escape notice and is indeed worthy of recognition. \\nDevelopments in southern Africa, and more particularly in Namibia with regard to the implementation of the United Nations independence plan, are welcome signals of hope, but amidst the hopes there are still dark reminders of the precariousness of global political reconciliation. A number of problems remain unsolved and several of these, such as the conflicts in the Middle East, continue to simmer.\\nWe are therefore at an important crossroads. We feel that there is enough good will to set in motion the process of evolution towards peace and stability. We see signs that the human intellect is resourceful enough to devise ideas that are conducive to our survival. Fresh concepts of peace and security have gained currency, but at the same time we continue to live under the dark shadow of nuclear devices. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, both horizontally and vertically, is a tragic reminder of the difficulties and obstacles which stand between mankind and lasting peace.\\nOn the economic front hard choices need to be made. The 1980s have witnessed one of the longest spells of growth for the industrialized countries, while the situation in the South, particularly in the least developed countries, continues to deteriorate. Benefits of trade continue to be disproportionate. Commodity prices have not regained their value in real terms. Aid flows continue to be inadequate. The debt burden borne by many third world countries is stifling economic growth and efforts for development, causing political instability. The link between economic development and the environment has recently been recognized and it is encouraging to note the high profile given to environmental issues at the Paris summit meeting of the Group of Seven in July this year, in this regard, it is of particular interest that there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the fact that certain technologies have a deleterious effect on the environment. The question is how these technologies can be replaced through a global programme of co-operation.\\nNo single fact, no single object, defines our moment in civilization more than does the existence of large nuclear arsenals. we have the horrible capacity to destroy our planet several times other, either by accident or by design. Nuclear weapons instil fear and beget mistrust and insecurity. They have a remarkable tendency to set hostile relations in concrete. They aggravate the security dilemma of states and perpetuate a confliction mode of behaviour. This, therefore, fuels the arms race and defence budgets soar while expenditures that are benevolent tend to plummet. \\nThe UN Conference on the relationship between disarmament and development served as a timely reminder of the opportunity costs of armaments, both nuclear and conventional. However the opportunity cost of nuclear weaponry is not only development. The international political climate and the security perceptions of states, as well as the environment, are actual and potential sacrifices to\\nnuclear weapons. Furthermore. the potential horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons issues the stark and grim warning that regional rivalries would be on an ever shorter fuse and that cataclysm would be that much closer.\\nIt is in view of these strong objections  to nuclear weapons and their Proliferation and deployment that my delegation has consistently and strongly supported United Nations calls for disarmament.\\nThe confidence that can he derived from genuine arms reduction has a pervasive effect on the security environment. The transition that many of the world's conflict, are making towards negotiations and understanding owes a great deal to improved relations between the super-Powers, which were themselves in part inspired by the historic arms reduction agreement of December 1987 for this reason -at Maldives has always supported all efforts with a view to general and complete disarmament, including the total elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and reduction in conventional armaments. We also believe that nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace could inspire trust, good Will and operation among states, transforming into secure communities contributing to global peace and security. We therefore support calls for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. \\nI express my delegation's fullest support for the people of Namibia, with our Namibia achieved their independence.  Apartheid is an affront to mankind and a crime against humanity. No amount of tinkering with it can placate the sense of outrage and indignation felt by the world community for this immoral practice. No amount of cosmetic change can restore Justice and dignity to the oppressed majority in South Africa. Maldives express our solidarity with the oppressed majority in South Africa in their struggle against apartheid. We condemn unequivocally the system of apartheid and condemn Pretoria regime for its continued defiance of the UN resolutions.  \\nBy far the greatest conflict in our time has been and continues to be the conflict in the Middle East. At the heart of this conflict is the question of Palestine. However, it is only in recent years that the Palestinian issue has evoked even a reasoned amount of concern in some key States. The search for peace continues to be frustrated by the hard-line and obstinate policies of Israel. Meanwhile, the situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate. The 22 month long intifadah emphasizes the intensity of the situation posed by Zionist occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories, including Jerusalem.\\nThe Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the blatant abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We also deplore the continued defiance by Israel of United Nations resolutions and its violation of international law and all norms of civilized behaviour. We reiterate our full support and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for self-determination and independence. We therefore welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising, which is being viewed as the just and valiant struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable rights. We extend our whole-hearted support to the proposal for an early convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the full and independent participation of Palestine.\\nThe situation in Lebanon remains volatile. The civil war, now in its fifteenth year, continues to take an increasing toll of human life. We fervently hope that, with the developments taking place in the region and elsewhere, the question of Lebanon will be solved in a manner which will restore its independence and national integrity, and alleviate the sufferings of its people. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the members of the Arab league, both past and present, to resolve the situation in Lebanon and we request the international community to give their support to the people of Lebanon in their efforts to solve their problems.\\nOn a more hopeful note, we are pleased that, contrary to some early pessimistic assessments, the cease-fire agreed on between Iran and Iraq in the Gulf has held firm, indicating the sincerity of the parties to the conflict. We welcome the commitments undertaken by them to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. In particular, we applaud the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General for the resolution of this conflict and urge both parties to maintain the momentum of peace created and envisaged by the cease-fire. \\nWhile we welcome the positive developments in Afghanistan - I refer to the withdraw of foreign troops - we regret that the situation has not been completely settled. We reiterate our call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the provisions of the Geneva Agreements in order not to frustrate the prevailing opportunities for a just and lasting solution to the problem. We urge the international community to provide humanitarian and economic assistance for the relief and rehabilitation of refugees, as well as for the long-term reconstruction of that ravaged country.  \\nPositive strides have been taken towards the solution of the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the withdraw of the Vietnamese troops and we appreciate the diplomatic efforts to obtain a comprehensive and lasting solution to the dispute including the Jakarta informal meeting as well as the international conference in Paris. However, realizing the delicacy of the current situation, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint. \\nThe process of reunification of peoples should be through peaceful means and by the creation of conditions conducive to reconciliation, peace and stability among those sharing the same aspirations. We remain optimistic about the prospects for peaceful national reconciliation in the Korean peninsula. The good office of the UN could be utilized in these peace negotiations.  \\nAnother issue that needs our attention is the situation in Cyprus. That prolonged inter-communal dispute should be solved urgently, with due regard to the national integrity of the nation and the aspirations of its peoples. We welcome the recent high-level contacts between the two communities and hope that the revived inter-communal dialogue will lead to inter-communal reconciliation on the basis of equality and integrity for both communities. We commend the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in searching for a settlement to the conflict.\\nAs I have already noted, the world economic situation continues to be bleak for the developing countries. Their situation has been worsened by the limited of aid since the early 1980s, rampant domestic inflation, crippling debts and the exorbitant burden of debt-servicing. The situation is aggravated by their falling share in international trade, by persistent negative trends in the terms of trade, owing to protectionism, and by the upsurge in unilateralism and other practices that jeopardize the multilateral nature of trade. It is regrettable that, on the whole, despite recent measures whereby the resources of the international finance institutions have been increased by the plans of some of the most developed countries to recycle part of their surplus into the developing countries, the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance has not been met. Moreover, as regards the least developed countries, which continue to register negative growth rates, the official development assistance target of 0.15 per cent of GNP has not been met either.\\nEconomic insecurity is not the only visible threat facing many of us in the world today. Indeed, we consider the environment to be one of the most important aspects of the quality of life that we have to address now in our quest for economic and industrial development. We welcome the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development and regard the event as a valuable opportunity which should be fully utilized to promote a comprehensive approach to the environmental problems related to the development activities of mankind.\\nWhile serious efforts are being made at global, regional and national levels to protect the environment, my delegation is particularly concerned about the effects of the degradation of the environment, especially the depletion of the ozone layer and the consequent global warming and rise in sea level. Maldives is a low-lying archipelagic State, entirely dependent upon its surrounding seas. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem, or any rise in the mean sea level, is a matter of grave concern to the Maldives, it will be recalled that two years ago we witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions, which caused extensive damage, with the assistance of friendly countries, we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated islands from possible natural calamities. Tidal waves, hurricanes and typhoons are increasingly frequent phenomena, and today there is a greater awareness that man's tampering with the environment and certain technologies inimical to the environment do have a direct bearing on the behaviour of the global weather system.\\nMaldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Our interest in the issue continues undiminished, and we welcome the universal interest that has been expressed in the preservation of the environment. I should like also to mention that in November this year the Maldives will host a conference of small States on sea-level rise. We are confident that the conference will contribute to the global efforts in addressing this important issue.\\nIt is an old and true maxim that the best indicator of the strength and stability of an international security system or political order is the survival of its weakest members. That being the case, and in view of the implications, the ever-increasing dangers of terrorism and mercenarism to the sovereignty of small and weak States are appalling.\\nTerrorism is not simply a minor irritant to anybody - least of all, to the small nations whose sovereignty is not only held hostage but can be easily usurped. The very existence of this possibility in the first place does not augur well for the security of the international community. The cherished principles that have so long contributed to the survival of the present State system and that are indispensable values of our global civilization are at stake. Today it may be we, the small States, whose sovereignty can be robbed by a handful of mercenaries or a gang of bounty hunters. Tomorrow it could be the larger countries, which, even at present, face some erosion of their sovereignty and security by similar acts. The difference is that when a small State is subjected to a terrorist onslaught or an invasion by mercenaries the consequences can be irreversible, both in political and in economic terms. We in the Maldives were close to becoming the victim of such a dastardly attempt last November.\\nIt is evident that peoples engaging in acts of terrorism and mercenarism, which endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, need to be deterred. The security of small States is too weak to be taken care of by mere self-help. The implications that efforts to strengthen their own security have for the prospects of economic development through the severe, if at all affordable, opportunity costs and the impact on social and political values, as well as the long-term implications for the sustenance of democracy in a militarised society, are negative. By requesting the inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly of an item related to the protection and security of small States, we sought to highlight the issue that I have just mentioned. We brought the issue to this forum not because we are unwilling to defend our values, nor have we taken it up here because our peoples lack valour. \\nSmall States do have as friends States that can assist, and have assisted, in strengthening their security. While we are grateful for the sense of duty that these friends have shown, it is with regret that we note that bilateral security arrangements in the international system have not yet evolved to a level of maturity whereby the interests of the weaker partner can be safeguarded. Nor are the socio-political identity of the weaker State and the principle of sovereign equality strong enough to be impervious to the possible vicissitudes of unequal relationships. Moreover, our political systems continue to be afflicted by misconceptions which can distort actions taken with the best of intentions. Consequently, the greater the power differential, the greater the propensity to misconceptions and the more hapless the predicament of the weaker parties. It is for this reason that we believe that multilateral frameworks are the most feasible nodes of a sound security mechanism for the weakest Members of the Organization, even if the actual support or assistance in a given situation is rendered at a regional or bilateral level.\\nAs I noted earlier, it is my humble opinion that we are at a pivotal point, an important crossroads in our global political development. It is our belief that we are at a particularly auspicious moment in history to forge ahead in strengthening the norms of our global political and security systems. Thus it is our sincere hope that the Organization will take a similar momentous step, a leap forward in ushering in a new era of security for the small States. We trust that this critical step will be taken to safeguard the principles which are espoused by the Organization and on which the survival of a large number of this community depends.\\n  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                     ﻿\\nMay I begin by congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your wide experience in the United Nations makes you especially qualified to guide the Assembly and its deliberations. You have my best wishes for the demanding task that lies ahead of you. May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Dante Caputo, who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General. We owe a great deal to his authority and leadership.\\nAs we are assembled here for the annual general debate, every Member state needs to reflect on certain fundamental questions. Is the United Nations doing everything possible in order to meet its challenges? Are we making progress? Can we say that the United Nations enters the last decade of this century with determination and justified self-confidence? Is my own country doing everything it can in order to help the world Organization? The answers to these questions must be sought in the actual work of the Organization and of its Member States. For my part, I shall try to emphasize some of the challenges we in Finland regard as particularly imports at the present time. It seems to us that the main challenges can be expressed in two words -insecurity and poverty. Both produce fear  d suffering. Neither can be dealt with by any single remedy.\\nThe United Nations was created first and foremost in order to maintain international peace and security. In this respect, the past year represents a mixture of success and disappointment. We are encouraged by the high-level dialogues that have continued between the major Powers. we have witnessed with satisfaction such concrete achievements as the continuing progress in the verified dismantling and destruction of American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. As one of the participating States in the process of the Conference on Security and cooperation in Europe, Finland follow, closely and with ,much hope the new efforts to achieve substantive conventional disarmament in Europe.\\nAt the same time we are concerned about the violence that has erupted and continues in many parts of the world. Most of the underlying problem are already on the agenda of the General Assembly, and we shall express our views on them in due course. Now I want to speak about the global challenges. As regards the process of disarmament on the global level our hopes in Finland are fastened particularly on the preparation of a chemical weapons convention. The political will is there, as was demonstrated again at the conferences held in Paris and in Canberra this year. During this year, as before, Finnish experts have continued their research in order to help to develop appropriate methods that could meet the complex verification requirements  global and comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We expect progress from the protracted negotiations with growing impatience. We welcome the impetus recently given them in the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.\\nSecurity on the global level must take into account other factors in addition to armaments and military threats. Security requires confidence in the future. Such confidence must be felt both by Governments and by their peoples. Only a representative Government that respects human rights and that therefore enjoys the confidence of its own people can face the future with a sense of security and successfully maintain stable relations with other Governments. Some dramatic - in fact, tragic - events have recently illustrated the importance of respect for human rights. We hope that lessons have been learned.\\nConfidence in the future also requires that the other global challenge, that of poverty, be overcome. The sufferings of poverty may not be in evidence everywhere, but the challenge requires global co-operation for development. The Assembly will meet next year in a special session devoted to international economic co-operation. Soon thereafter a new international development strategy for the 1990s should be adopted. A successful special session and a new and realistic strategy should help to bring about a new spirit of international economic co-operation.\\nIn the process of preparing both the development strategy and the special session emphasis should be on the development of human resources in all forms, including the recognition of a well-functioning private sector in balance with an effective public sector. In that context funding generated by national and international sources should be well co-ordinated. The necessary investments in developing countries require increasing domestic and external financing.\\nThe debt overhang has resulted in the transfer of resources from developing countries, which exceeded $US 50 billion last year, a trend that should be reversed. This requires that a political solution, including a functioning debt strategy, be found. The debt overhang cannot be overcome by the international community at the upcoming special session of the General Assembly and in the new international development strategy. It would be important for the efforts to reverse the transfer of resources from the developing countries if the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as development-and transfer were generally reached. For its part, Finland will this year reach that target set by the General Assembly.\\nThe structure of the United Nations in the economic and social fields should respond to the tasks to be specified in the strategy for the 1990s, thus -consolidating the role of the world Organization. The Finnish Government finds that the Secretary-General has a major catalytic role to play in putting forward concrete proposals to improve the Organization's effectiveness in those fields. That would also help Governments in agreeing on the areas where they are to concentrate the activities of the United Nations in the economic and social fields. Today I wish to emphasize two issues that must, in my opinion, have a Prominent place in this respect. Development cannot be sustainable if the world population continues to grow at its present rate. Development cannot be sustainable if the natural resources of the Earth continue to be depleted at the present rate. There is a growing awareness of such problems in all parts of the world. That awareness is more and more strongly reflected in the work of the United Nations, it has prompted a number of positive measures. More is needed.\\nAccording to recent United Nations estimates the world population could stabilize in the twenty-first century at the level of 10 to 11 billion persons. An early stabilisation of population growth would, of course, facilitate the fight against poverty. To reach that goal, determined population policies, translated into national population plans as spelled out in the World Population Plan of Action, should be pursued vigorously.\\nWith regard to the protection of the environment, no problem has lately become\\nso apparent and widely recognized as the problem of climate change. Both industrialized and developing countries are directly affected by the depletion of the ozone layer through increasing emissions of carbon dioxides, which produce the so-called greenhouse effect in the climate of the Earth, and by the increasing presence of substances in the atmosphere that cause acid rain and direct dangers to health.\\nIt is therefore hardly a surprise that we have witnessed increasing international activity in this field. Several initiatives have been taken to launch concerted international action to combat atmospheric pollution in all its aspects, including climatic change. It is our view that effective strategies and policies should be developed by the international community as soon as possible in all fields relating to environment. That is a major undertaking that requires consolidated effort by the General Assembly and by the relevant United Nations specialized and other agencies. Environmental problems have a universal character. Any new activities should be streamlined with already ongoing action and well-established treaty-making procedures. The General Assembly must play a pivotal role in that effort.\\nFive months ago Finland hosted a Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer aid the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Those instruments, of 1985 and 1987 respectively, have this year already been found inadequate in light of the latest advances in knowledge. At the Conference the representatives of the more than 80 States present agreed unanimously to the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of  the Ozone Layer, which contains an ambitious undertaking to phase out completely the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000, or sooner if possible, and to phase out other ozone-depleting substances as soon as possible. We expect that undertaking to be converted into a legally binding decision at next year's meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Appropriate measures should also be undertaken to make environmentally sound substitutes widely available to developing countries as soon as possible.\\nIn the field of environment protection the problems that are typical in the industrialized countries are often also found in the big urban centres of the developing countries. The problems that are now typical in many developing countries - such as soil erosion and the destruction of forests - illustrate mistakes already committed by earlier generations, most of all in Europe. We can therefore all learn from each other. There is information available about the environment and its protection, and about earlier mistakes. The available knowledge needs to be applied and converted into practical programmes, not only on the level of global strategies, but also on the level of regional, national and local development.\\nIn our own development co-operation programmes, we in Finland have emphasized such activities as deforestation, where we feel that we have some experience and expertise. We see deforestation as urgent in order to help stop soil erosion, counteract the greenhouse effect and counterbalance the continued cutting of trees for fuel and for other immediate human needs. In this respect, the development of new and renewable soirees of energy is of crucial importance.\\nOn a broader scale, we look forward to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We see it as representing probably the most important joint effort required of mankind during the remaining part of this century. This session of the General Assembly is called upon to take important decisions for the preparation of the Conference. In that connection, as in all our activities to face up to environmental problems, we in Finland will strongly emphasize the need to support the developing countries in order to ensure that their development is environmentally sustainable.\\nA large part of the burden, particularly for financing research and the introduction of new environmentally sound technologies, will have to be borne by the industrialized countries. We accept our part of this burden, knowing of course that all states will have to share in the efforts according to their capabilities. Since concern for the environment is global, this concern should in our opinion give a further incentive to all States without exception to involve themselves\\nactively in international co-operation for environmentally sound and sustainable development. We also think that the time is ripe for the preparation of structural reforms making the United Nations Organization more responsive to the problems of protecting the environment. My Government has an open mind regarding the various ideas that have been discussed. We would find it natural for this Assembly to take decisions ensuring environmental Questions a permanent and prominent place in the structure of the Organization.\\nOne of the activities of the United Nations which has rightly gained prominence during this year is peace-keeping. At the present time, Finland is the biggest contributor of personnel to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Their total strength is close to 15,000, and the number of Finnish personnel is now almost 2,000. It is therefore with particular satisfaction that we in Finland share the pride felt in this house over the latest Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In co-operation with the other Nordic countries, Finland has this year taken steps to share with other interested States its experiences concerning the training and preparation of national contingents for peace-keeping tasks.\\nWe are also satisfied at the reactivation of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. The accumulated experiences in this field have already grown to such an extent that it is high time indeed to make a thorough review of all practical proposals that may help to strengthen the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping.\\nIn this connection, I wish to emphasize the importance of finding a lasting solution to the financial difficulties that still affect current peace-keeping operations, thus indirectly undermining the financial basis of the whole Organization. The idea of having sufficient financial reserves for peacemaking and peace-keeping, particularly for the start-up phase of operations, which my   predecessor put forward in his address to the General Assembly last year, has received support in a number of Quarters. I note in particular that the Secretary-General, in his own report to the General Assembly, has referred to the possibility of establishing a special reserve fund for peace-keeping, to be supported by all Member States. We hope that this idea can soon be followed up in practice with full respect for the principle of collective responsibility. The first condition, in our view, is that Member states should accept the principle of financing all operations without exception through assessed contributions and that they should pay all their assessed contributions in full and on time.\\nThe principal factor explaining the recent growth in the participation of Finnish personnel in United Nations peace-keeping is the deployment of an enlarged battalion within the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. A sizable number of volunteer soldiers has thus been added to the two Finnish battalions and smaller units already serving in the Middle East and elsewhere.\\nNamibia is a major test for the United Nations. The beginnings of the UOTAG operations to implement Security Council resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia were unexpectedly rough and difficult. It is still too early to draw conclusions from the whole process of transition to independence, but we believe that the programme has been brought back on track thanks to the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General and the competent performance of the UNTAG personnel. Of course, many problems still remain to be solved and call for our unrelenting attention. We are looking forward with confidence to the moment when we can welcome independent Namibia into our midst as a Member State of the United Nations. For Finland, Namibia will be a major partner in our development co-operation.  The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a persistent threat to international security. The dangers of the absence of peace in the area are demonstrated almost daily. Repressive measures continue in the territories illegally occupied by Israel. The cycle of violence has not been broken. The\\neking turmoil in Lebanon gives cause for deep concern. There must be a way to or the suffering of the Lebanese people by the common endeavours of the Lebanese themselves, the Arab League and the international community.\\nIt is pressingly urgent that the way should be prepared towards an international peace conference and, further, to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. There is an almost universal recognition of the basic principles for a settlement. The right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries, as well as the right of the Palestinians to national determination, should be recognised. Democratic elections in the occupied territories could facilitate this process. If such elections are properly mentored and take place within the framework of a structured effort, they could provide a link in a process leading to a comprehensive settlement. The momentum for achieving a solution to this long-standing conflict will be lost unless all possible avenues are pursued vigorously and with an open mind. In this respect, the proposals made by President Mubarak of Egypt are welcome and merit serious consideration.\\nThe United Nations has manifestly demonstrated its relevance and strengthened its role as a forum for co-ordinated international action. Yet the world Organization and its member States can do more. Serious global problems call for urgent global solutions. Only a re-invigorated United Nations can answer the challenges the world will inevitably face in the 1990s and beyond. Let us unite our forces to make the United Nations capable of meeting those challenges. \\n  \n",
       "2  ﻿\\nMr. President, it is a particular pleasure for me, on behalf of the delegation of Niger, to congratulate you moat warmly on your brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. By unanimously entrusting you with the onerous task of guiding its work the Assembly has wished to testify to the active role played in the international arena by your great country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which is united by old, fruitful, strong and varied link with the Republic of Niger in promoting and defending the ideals of international peace, harmony and security and in striving for greater equity and justice in international economic relations.\\nYour election is thus a confirmation of your outstanding qualities, an eminent diplomat, you are an expert in your field, a man whose experience, talent and strong convictions compel admiration and promise a fruitful outcome to our work. Finally, it is a tribute paid to Africa as a whole. I wish to assure you of the complete availability and co-operation of my delegation in helping you to accomplish your task.\\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, we would like to express out full appreciation and gratitude for the wisdom, skill and efficiency with which he presided over the work of the forty-third session.\\nlb the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, I should like to repeat the whole-hearted support and encouragement of General Ali Saibou, President of the Supreme Council of National Guidance, Head of State, for the tireless efforts he is making on behalf of peace. We commend the dynamic work the Secretary-General has carried out at the head of this Organization, which he has now rehabilitated and whose authority, prestige and credibility he has restored.\\nFinally, I welcome Mr. Ronald Spiers, the new Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, who succeeds Ambassador Reed. We wish him every success in the accomplishment of his new task.\\nThe sessions of the General Assembly are opportunities for the international community to make further progress in the quest for peace, justice and harmony among peoples in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter. It is in this spirit that the delegation of Niger intends once again to make its contribution to the bread discussion of problems of concern to humanity.\\nSwift and profound changes are taking place in the international arena. We are seeing political, economic, social, cultural and even ideological changes which are shaping and foreshadowing international relations and the new stakes and challenges of the next century. These changes are sure to have a decisive influence on the future of nations and peoples.\\nThe new dynamic in the feature of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly with the signature and entry into force of the Treaty on the Elimination of Their Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, is grounds for hope. That agreement and the thaw in relations between the two super-Powers has created a general climate of co-operation and detente and has helped to prepare the way for the settlement of several regional and local conflicts.\\nThe treaties and agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States are basic attainments} they testify to the political will of those two countries to curb the danger which the arms race represents for mankind. We must however note that the danger continues because the means of warfare are of necessity lethal, are still considerable and are increasingly sophisticated. For that reason the two super-Powers should intensify and pursue, with greater determination and will, their negotiations on the reduction of their stockpiles both nuclear and conventional.\\nIn this respect we are pleased with the constructive proposals made a few days ago from this rostrum, by the President of the United States of America and the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs respectively, with regard to the elimination of chemical weapons and of conventional weapons. These proposals, if accepted by both parties, would, we believe, help to promote substantial progress towards general and complete disarmament.\\nThe survival of mankind is our common responsibility and implies that we must avoid a nuclear disaster, which is still possible, by significantly reversing present trends. It is certainly frustrating to note the state of the world today and to see that today we have a striking if not repugnant paradox on the one hand there is the exponential increase in military budgets, and arsenals and on the other there is the chronic poverty and wretchedness of many in the world We must give full weight to the Action Programme adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which provides for the creation of institutional financial mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of resources saved through disarmament measures to economic and social development activities.\\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when significant and encouraging progress has been noted in many regional conflicts, some of which have been controlled and virtually settled thanks to the merits of dialogue and negotiation, while others are on the right path with good chances of success. However, the persistence of stubborn hotbeds of tension or situations of injustice and the appearance or intensification of certain disputes still pose a dangerous threat to international peace and security in many regions of the world.\\nWe must work tirelessly, and persevere in the quest for and consolidation of peace. He must take advantage of this thaw in international relations to make significant advances towards the realization of our peoples' legitimate aspiration to peace, justice and human dignity.\\nIn Africa, the situation in Namibia and South Africa continues to centre on the long-awaited outcome of the Namibian people's heroic struggle for independence and on tine persistence of the despicable system of apartheid. The international community's tireless efforts are finally about to bear fruits the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia has been under way since 1 April 1989. Yet it is more indispensable than ever before to show determination, vigilance and solidarity to prevent the Pretoria racist regime from crushing our efforts.\\nUnfortunately, I must condemn yet again tine intimidation and harassment against the freedom-fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SHAFO), the reprisals perpetrated by the sinister Koevoet forces, the manipulation of electoral rolls, the assassination of Namibian patriots and SHAFO leaders, such as the 12 September murder of Anton Lubowski. All these acts testify to the disarray of the racist regime and remind us that there are still many real dangers that the process will be derailed, and that constant vigilance is required.\\nIt is the duty of the Organization, the permanent members of the Security Council and the entire international community to ensure that the spirit and the letter of Security Council resolutions 435 (1578) and 632 (1989) are scrupulously respected by all parties and that the Namibian people has the opportunity and means to elect a Government of Its choice next month freely, peacefully and without manoeuvres, intimidation or coercion.\\nIn South Africa itself, apartheid persists, The new political leadership of the country is aiming to win time through various subterfuges. He must not be Misled by recent declarations of purely superficial constitutional reforms or by the pseudo-elections of 6 September last. They leave untouched the real problem: the perpetuation of the apartheid system, which denies the black majority the right to participate fully in the political and democratic management of its country.\\nMr. President, as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid you are very well aware that apartheid cannot be reformed. It is a disgrace to humanity and an anachronism of world civilization; it must be dismantled, pure and simple. But we note that the friends of the South African regime still hesitate to adopt bold sanctions against the apartheid regime. They must understand and weigh the danger to themselves of stubborn support - even passive support - for a system founded on inequality, exploitation and the denial of human rights.\\nFor that reason, Niger appeals again to the international community to maintain and indeed increase its pressure on the South African regime, so the comprehensive mandatory sanctions ordered by the Security Council and the General Assembly in the relevant resolutions can be effectively imposed against South Africa. Only such sanctions will make it see reason and lift its policy of internal repression and destabilization of neighbouring States, lift the bans that hobble the anti-apartheid movement, and immediately and unconditionally free all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, Today more than ever before, this is a matter of a true social pact and a duty of genuine solidarity for the international community vis-à-vis the South African people and all the peoples of southern Africa.\\nWe call on the international community to support fully the conclusions reached by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which met at Harare on 21 August and adopted a declaration on the peace process in southern Africa. We call on it firmly to support the Gbadolite agreements of 22 June last and all the efforts to restore peace in Angola, and to encourage similar initiatives for national reconciliation and the restoration of peace in Mozambique,\\nA local conflict that has just exploded on our continent is causing us great concern and sadness, for it concerns two fraternal countries that are dear to us two countries that should stand united and cleave to one another; two countries members of the organization for the Development of the Senegal River, the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel, the West African Economic Community, the Economic Community of West African States, the OAU, the organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\\nAs a member of the ministerial mediation commission established by the organization of African Unity, Niger is working with the other member countries towards the prompt and final settlement of this unfortunate affair. We therefore take this opportunity to renew our appeal to Senegal and Mauritania to refrain from any action that could increase tension, and to co-operate fully with the African mediation commission in its efforts to restore as soon as possible between the two peoples the understanding, harmony, fraternity, solidarity and common destiny to which geography, history and the Islamic faith destine - I was about to say doom - them.\\nI am pleased to note that between Chad and Libya - two other fraternal countries that are neighbours of Niger - dialogue is continuing and strengthening ever time, thus promoting a comprehensive, final settlement of the dispute that has long set them against one another and that has cost their peoples so dearly. Niger welcomed the conclusion on 31 August of the Algiers agreement, which consolidated the cease-fire and ushered in a new era of peace, mutual trust and fraternal\\nco-operation for the two countries. We congratulate them and urge them to sustain this momentum in the interest of their peoples arid the entire sub region.\\nIn Western Sahara, the process begun by the Secretary-General's peace plan and conducted jointly with the current Chairman of the OAU is under way, and we support it. We urge the parties involved in this painful conflict to continue and indeed intensify their efforts to create conditions that would favour the organization under United Nations auspices of a referendum on self-determination.\\nIn the Middle East, the Palestinian people is heroically continuing its resistance to illegal occupation and repression. The conditions, the framework and the means for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East are well known. They include the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, the strict implementation in that connection of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the convoking under United Nations auspices of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). There is no possible alternative to those conditions and their complete implementation} otherwise there can be no fair and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\\nAlong with the rest of the international community, Niger welcomed the peace initiative announced on 13 December 1988 in Geneva, and the many peaceful overtures made by the PLO. We therefore regret the lack of a positive response from the Israeli Government to the Palestinian side's constructive position. None the less, we hope that both sides will show realism and responsibility by accepting the 10-point proposal put forward by the President of Egypt, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, we feel that proposal could create conditions for a constructive and satisfactory outcome. In the meantime, we urgently appeal for strict respect for the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, in order to protect civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories against the repression practised by the Israeli forces trying - vainly - to stifle the intifadah.\\nWe continue to be concerned by the tragedy the people of Lebanon has endured for the past 15 years. A State Member of this Organization is truly wasting away. Can we remain powerless and inactive in the face of that unacceptable situation? The international community must do everything in its power to preserve the identity, unity, territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon, and to achieve national reconciliation amongst all its sons. Niger is endeavouring to do this. We support fully the efforts made by the League of Arab States and the Tripartite Committee which it set up to find a solution to this tragedy.\\nWe are pleased to note that there has been a real abatement in the conflict between Iran and Iraq over the last year. My country again declares its support for the clear-sighted efforts made by the Secretary-General and urges the two parties to co-operate fully with him, not only to consolidate the cease-fire but also to make progress towards a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement to the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\\nRegarding Afghanistan, Niger is pleased at the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements, which made possible the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country„ We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts to facilitate a comprehensive, political settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva agreements and General Assembly resolution 43/20. The return to real peace in Afghanistan requires strict respect for the right of the Afghan people to decide independently its own fate, and requires respect for its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and of its status as a non-aligned State.\\nWe are also watching closely the development of the situation in Kampuchea, particularly the decision on the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. The International Conference held in Paris from 30 July to 3 August 1989, offers, in my delegation's view, a timely opportunity for ail the parties involved and directly concerned to find, through dialogue and reflection, a comprehensive, honourable and definitive solution to the tragedy of Cambodia.\\nEven if the results of that Conference did not measure up to the hopes we had placed in them, the Conference is certainly an important step towards a peaceful solution. The Cambodian people must be able to determine freely their own destiny without any foreign interference. Dialogue amongst all the sons of Cambodia must continue and must be intensified. In this respect Niger welcomes and encourages the commendable efforts made by the French and Indonesian Co-Chairmen.\\nThe aspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification are yet to be realized. We strongly encourage the two parties to continue the contacts and the dialogue which they have begun with a view to the reunification of Korea without foreign interference. In regard to Cyprus we are pleased with the efforts made by the Secretary-General through his Special Representative. The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island must be guaranteed and its national unity and non-aligned status must be respected.\\nConcerning Central America we are following and we welcome the praiseworthy efforts made by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to eliminate the combined impact of tension and violence and to establish the basis for true peace and co-operation. From the Contadora Agreements to those of Tesoro Beach and Tela, together with the Esquipulas II Agreements, we can gauge the determination with which the heads of State of the region are seeking means to establish a true peace. All of their initiatives and their efforts deserve the full support of this Assembly.\\nThey deserve it all the more since a terrible scourge which is afflicting all of humanity and jeopardizing the fabric of society, has over the last few months and in a brutal way, focused world attention on this region of the world. Indeed, the fight against drug trafficking in Latin America has become total war, the outcome of which will determine the capacity of the international community to display strength, determination and solidarity. This challenge involves, without any doubt, the fate and future of mankind as a whole.\\nNiger gives its support to Colombia and to all countries involved in this battle, world-wide, and urges the international community to set in motion a consistent strategy to win this struggle, which involves and challenges us all.\\nAnother problem, indeed another scourge, which is equally disturbing and whose innocent victims are increasing in numbers throughout the world, is that of international terrorism. Last year. Pan Am flight 103, from London to New York, crashed in Scotland, with several hundreds of victims, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia. On behalf of Niger, we pay a tribute once again to his memory. A few months ago Colonel Higgins, a man working for peace, was assassinated in cold blood. Recently, an aircraft of the UTA company, on a flight between Brazzaville and Paris, exploded in mid-air over territory of my country, killing 171 innocent victims. These are only a few examples, but unfortunately there are many others. On behalf of President Ali Saibou and the people of Niger, I express here to all the States whose nationals perished in the tragedy of this UTA flight our deep sympathy and our sincere condolences.\\nTerrorism is the evil of our century. It strikes out blindly and indiscriminately. He must launch a real, unified crusade, a sacred union even, to combat terrorism, which today transcends national borders and political and ideological differences. Niger and its government are determined to make their contribution, however modest, to the struggle, which affects us all.\\nThe present climate of detente, which has prevailed for at least a year in international relations, should encourage the world to reflect further on the ways\\nand means of restoring peace wherever it has been disturbed, to preserve it everywhere it is threatened, and to strengthen it wherever it has been established.\\nThe period of calm in the political arena is contrasted, however, very sharply with the world economic situation characterized, unfortunately, by a profound structural imbalance. In fact, unequal development between North and South is the main contradiction in the world today. It is clear however that peace and security are directly linked with development. Thus the climate of detente which prevails at this time in the world would be vain and have no future if the developing countries continue to have to deal with difficulties which are constantly aggravated through imbalance, inequality and flagrant injustice in their economic relations with the industrialized countries.\\nThe gap between developed countries and developing countries is widening day by day. Whereas in the North there is talk of growth and expansion, in the South the talk is still about food self-sufficiency and structural adjustment. Men, women and children of Africa, of Asia, and of Latin America and the Caribbean, are living through the tragedy of hunger, poverty, illiteracy, natural disasters such as drought, desertification, plaques of locusts, cyclones, and so on. Societies that are just surviving, societies that are overwhelmed: that is the harsh reality of developing countries, of which, sadly, Africa has the greatest number.\\nThe causes of this trend are to be found essentially in the collapse in commodity prices, the deterioration in terms of trade and the crushing weight of external debt. These phenomena, which have led to a net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries, and the multilateral financial institutions, are stripping States in the South of every chance of development, thus making them incapable of creating the investments necessary for real and lasting growth.\\nGiven this situation, our Governments have undertaken profound economic reforms. These reforms, carried out at great social and political cost, have not enjoyed, as was hoped and promised, the full support of the international community. Less than two years from the time it was, theoretically, to come to an end, the five-year United Nations programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has still not really started.\\nAs the Secretary-General stressed in his annual report on the work of the organization, failure to find a solution could lead to a collapse of the social and political structures in many developing countries.\\nWhatever the case, it is urgently necessary that particular attention be given to the most vulnerable countries: the least developed countries, countries affected by drought and desertification, countries suffering from natural scourges and countries suffering from being land-locked, for whom a revival of economic and social development is a necessity.\\nFirst, new and lasting solutions to the problem o£ debt must be found through continuing consideration by and co-operation between creditor and debtor countries in all appropriate forums. In this regard, Niger welcomes the plans and initiatives so far put forward and supports the idea of an international conference on Africa's external debt, as advocated by the organization of African Unity. We welcome the decisions first of Canada, in 1987, and then of France this year, followed by those of Belgium and Italy, to cancel all debt relating to development assistance. Niger hopes - and this is our interest in an international conference on the debt - that those unilateral actions will be followed by collective measures, the fruit of a general and formal agreement between debtor countries and their creditor partners, both bilateral and multilateral.\\nSecondly, we must make a methodical and determined search for a new, more just and balanced international economic order in which economic and social security is guaranteed to all peoples. That new international economic order can be sought and achieved only within the framework of the North-South dialogue, which must be resumed.\\nIn the same context we welcome and firmly support the proposal made in July 1989 by the Presidents of Egypt, Senegal and Venezuela and the Prime Minister of India concerning the organization of regular summit consultations between North and South on problems of common interest to the two hemispheres.\\nIn this connection, the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular the revitalisation of economic growth and development in developing countries, to be held in April 1990, will constitute, we believe, a propitious occasion and an appropriate framework for the reinvigoration of the North-South dialogue. This applies also to the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Paris in 1990.\\nWe cherish the hope that these conferences and initiatives will contribute to the effective resumption of the North-South dialogue by offering the possibility of achieving an agreement on the nature of the problems facing developing countries and the approach to be taken towards solving them. Niger intends to participate actively and to make its contribution through concrete proposals that could lead to the emergence of a new era of healthy co-operation between North and South.\\nMoreover, we are particularly interested in the current negotiations on the new Lome convention, which in our view should serve as a model both as regards efforts to stabilize the export earnings of developing countries, assistance in the diversification of their exports and the opening of markets to their products, and as regards development assistance.\\n1 should like to conclude this section by expressing a concern that is widely shared by the countries represented here. I refer to the problem of children.\\nThe difficult economic situation in developing countries is the reason for the situation of children in those countries, and particularly in Africa being so worrying, despite the importance and priority which our Governments accord to the protection and well-being of children, since they represent the future.\\nThe results of efforts made by members of the international community, with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international organizations, to ensure the survival, protection and full development of the potential of children are encouraging. It is essential, however, to pursue and intensify our efforts collectively. That is why Niger firmly supports not only the idea of convening with urgency a world summit devoted to children, but also the conclusion and adoption as a top priority by the General Assembly at the present session of a draft convention on the rights of the child. The environment crisis, which is felt throughout the world and seriously threatens life on our planet, is a question to which the international community should pay urgent attention. Today, the degradation of the ozone layer, the heating of the atmosphere and climatic changes are as much a reality as deforestation, desertification of arable lands, pollution of water and the atmosphere, the disappearance of fauna and flora, toxic wastes, and the transfer of hazardous wastes to developing countries.\\nThe means of avoiding ecological disaster exist. We must use the available technology, improve it, and share it. To this end, it is imperative that Member States draw up co-ordinated plans of action to resolve the environmental crisis. That is a joint responsibility that calls for solidarity and it must be said that it is the duty of the industrialized countries to prevent or limit the damage caused to the world environment and to help our developing countries to achieve healthy development.\\nThe United Nations conference on environment and development proposed for 1992 will provide an excellent opportunity to work out agreed action at the world level and to define new principles of international law concerning the protection and conservation of the environment and, in particular, effective international measures to prohibit the transfer of hazardous wastes to the territories of other countries.\\nAs everybody knows and as is true of many African countries, the economic and social situation is the main and constant source of concern for the Government of Niger. Nevertheless, I am happy to inform the Assembly that President Ali Saibou has undertaken action aimed at the political evolution of our country with the ultimate objective of a return to constitutional life. Following the adoption by referendum of the National Charter in July 1987, the process of setting up apolitical system as the basis for the Second Republic of Niger entered its final, decisive phase with the establishment, in May 1989, of the National Movement for the Society in Development and the adoption by referendum on 24 September of a new Constitution.\\nAs the President, General Ali Saibou, said, the National Movement for the Society in Development will be the appropriate forum for political expression in which the women and men of Niger will strive to affirm and defend their political, economic and social rights. The goal is the realization of participatory democracy guaranteeing the free expression of ideological opinions and sentiments, in order to achieve a constructive political awareness and the consolidation of a stable and integrated regime involving all the components of our nation.\\nThe Constitution reaffirms the law character and republican nature of the State and makes Niger a State of law that respects the fundamental freedoms of individuals. It ensures the equality of all before the law and enshrines the principle of the sovereignty of the people.\\nIn that Constitution the people of Niger reaffirms its will to co-operate in friendship with all peoples that cherish peace, justice and freedom. It reiterates its total and permanent readiness to seek, with all the nations of the world, solutions to the innumerable ills that afflict the international community and to construct a world of peace, justice and progress in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\\nLegislative and presidential elections will take place on 10 December next, with direct universal suffrage, and will complete the process of a return to normal constitutional life in Niger.\\nThat is my delegation's contribution to the general debate at the forty-fourth session, which we wish the most outstanding success. We hope that it will  strengthen the unshakable faith of our Governments in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. We hope that it will instil in each of our peoples a planetary patriotism thanks to which we shall be able to succeed in our. undertaking and build slowly but surely a single, indivisible world of peace, happiness and human dignity.  \\n  \n",

                                                                                                 ﻿\\nDuring the debate at the fortieth session of the General Assembly four years ago, President Sanguinetti announced to the world community from this very rostrum that Uruguay had resumed its traditional path of political democracy, and was determined to respect and to enforce respect domestically for all human rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic, and further announced his firm resolve to resume active participation on the global stage of international relations in the pursuit of peace, universal respect for human rights and the equality of all nations, based on respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.\\nSix months prior to the conclusion of President Sanguinetti's constitutional term, I have the honour to mount the same rostrum to announce to this international community that today those intentions have been fully realized.\\nIndeed, within a few weeks, elections will be held in Uruguay to elect all the authorities who will be responsible for the destiny of the country for the next five years. This fact, commonplace in the political tradition of a democratic country, is particularly significant in out case, since it represents the culmination of a period of democratic recovery during which full respect for the Constitution has been restored? all individual rights have been scrupulously observed, and national reconciliation has been achieved, inter alia by a general amnesty ratified by popular mandate. Law and justice have been restored, and the country has been rescued from a declining economic situation through the vigorous revitalization of the external sector and the application of stabilizing policies which have allowed reasonable product growth, a decrease in unemployment and an increase in real earnings.\\nOn the international front, Uruguay has honoured all its commitments, including those of a financial nature which entailed - then and today - considerable sacrifices. It has actively contributed, at times beyond the power of its political weight and its material resources, to efforts aimed at reinforcing international peace, security and co-operation. It has embarked upon a firm policy of regional and sub regional integration and participates actively with other democracies in the hemisphere to co-ordinate positions in order to satisfy our common interests. In short, the Government of Uruguay is acting on the international scene, secure in the moral and political authority it derives from the right to represent a free, democratic, stable and peace-loving society. This task of democratic consolidation has been successful but also extremely difficult. As President Sanguinetti said to this Assembly in 1985:\\n'Democracy is a fragile flower; ... it only grows aid survives in the right soil and the right climate. A genuine democracy based on respect for the individual and an the periodical, free advice of the people can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. ... When this condition is not fulfilled, and poverty and unemployment prevail, violence emerges and is unleashed, the powers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil, the fabric of society disintegrates and, in the international sphere, political loyalties become erratic.' (A/40/PV.6, p. 12)\\nIndeed, democracy is never limited to a purely political dimension, nor is it a sufficient condition to ensure freedom for all the people.\\nThe economic and social component of a democratic society is what ultimately determines its feasibility aid stability. It is for this reason that the question posed by the foreign Ministers of the Group of 8 when considering the problem of foreign debt is a valid one today: How much poverty can freedom withstand?\\nLike democracy in other Latin American countries and other regions of the world, democracy in Uruguay has been constantly threatened by a severe economic crisis unprecedented in its history.\\nWe are aware - and this is always worth repeating - of our share of responsibility in the task of overcoming the crisis and promoting development and economic growth. We know that that is possible only through our own efforts, through the formulation and application of our own policies and, particularly, through our own sacrifices. But we are also aware that, despite the social and political cost of these adjustment processes, the expected benefits will not be obtained without greater participation and commitment by the industrialized countries, particularly in the areas of international finance and trade.\\nThe issue of underdevelopment, therefore, remains the major world problem faced by mankind. The growth achieved by a few Asian countries cannot hide the fact that there has been significant regression in the social indicators of many countries in Latin America and Africa. That bears eloquent testimony to the seriousness of the situation and the political risk to their governing institutions, and consequently to world peace.\\nThe vast foreign debt which weighs so heavily on many of our countries has reversed the flow of financial resources, which now runs from South to North. The task of turning the tide cannot be delayed, since this debt is paralysing all our efforts to achieve economic development and democratic stability.\\nIt is encouraging to note that creditor countries have new accepted the principle of shared responsibility in the foreign-debt problem, and have agreed that this problem is not simply financial but also political and social. It is also noteworthy and encouraging that creditor Governments appear willing to consider formulas to help the constrained economies of debtor nations.\\nIn this respect, the agreement between Mexico and its international bank creditors has set a precedent regarding the feasibility of the Brady philosophy and has aroused legitimate hopes and expectations in the rest of the debtor nations.\\nWithout a pragmatic approach to the debt problem there will be no development and no economic growth; without these prerequisites it will be very difficult to continue to believe in democracy, and without democracy world stability and peace will be very hard to maintain.\\nWhat we need today is a revolutionary change in our ideas and policies with respect to international economics, ultimately leading to the formulation of a new development strategy. The starting point of that strategy should be recognition of the interdependence of all States, whatever their size or economic or military power; and the objective should be to ensure that this interdependence is viewed as guaranteeing greater predictability and stability in world trade and economic relations and a more just distribution of the benefits.\\nThis new international strategy for development should be dynamic, flexible and, above all, concrete and precise in the formulation of measures designed to fight poverty, to eliminate protectionism and discrimination in international trade, and to facilitate access by all developing countries to technology and to the financial and economic markets of industrialized nations.\\nThe environmental dimension should be an essential ingredient in the new international development strategy. The deterioration of the environment has become a matter of concern to the entire international community and there is no doubt it will continue to be a matter of concern in the years to come.\\nThere can be no doubt that the environment must, be protected and that each State must assume responsibility and take action in this respect for its own well-being and for that of other peoples of the world. But it is also true that\\nthe correct solution to the problem requires sincere and broad international co-operation to ensure that the cost of protecting the environment is not borne by only a few countries which ate still struggling for full development of their un-exploited natural resources. In no case - and this is more important still - should protection of the environment become a new form of conditionality to which the sovereign decisions of countries still requiring international co-operation for their development would be subordinated.\\nIn summary, Uruguay is conscious of the urgent need to protect the environment-, but we are also aware that this is a task requiring the participation and efforts of the entire international community and that it should be carried out in a way compatible with the national sovereignty of all nations.\\nHowever, the implementation of a development policy that guarantees both the protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources requires the provision of financial resources and appropriate technologies not available to all the countries in the world.\\nAs we stated last year and repeat today: the technological dependence of the developing countries is not only a factor inhibiting their economic development, but also as a serious threat to their political sovereignty as that posed by foreign aggression.\\nThe cost of transferring financial and technological resources to developing countries represents barely a marginal fraction of the funds used by the super-Powers in the arms race, for which they invoke reasons of national security. They forget that reasons of national survival would make it mandatory for them to allocate more than a marginal fraction of that overall expenditure to the transfer of resources and technology to developing countries, thereby facilitating their\\nparticipation in the common task of protecting both world peace and the quality of the environment.\\nIn dealing with the question of the environment, the international community must resort to the basic mechanism of co-operation between nations because we are faced with a common danger, affecting us all, and there is no political system or degree of development or military Power than can give any State the slightest immunity against it.\\nUnfortunately, it is not only dangers to the environment that indiscriminately affect all nations and peoples. There are other reasons forcing us to resort to and develop the mechanisms of global solidarity and co-operation. Terrorism and drug trafficking, which at times appear to be complementary phenomena, continue to wreak destruction and havoc, despite the universal revulsion they arouse.\\nUruguay unequivocally condemns terrorism. For us, any terrorist act is inhuman and cruel, violates the most sacred human rights and reveals the basest and most destructive feelings of men. There is no purpose, no cause, no issue, however noble, that can justify the commission of a terrorist act. For that reason, Uruguay will contribute, without qualifications based on motives or purposes, to efforts directed at establishing new legal measures and at strengthening existing ones providing for the eradication of this scourge from the face of the earth.\\nWith respect to drug trafficking, we are concerned at the rate at which it has expanded and at the vast power behind it, but at the same time we are encouraged to see that the governments of consumer nations have become aware of their responsibilities and that producer nations have shouldered the risks involved in an open war against drug traffickers. In this connection, it is my duty, and my pleasure, to express to the Government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas and to the people of Colombia the solidarity of the Government of Uruguay in respect of recent events in our sister Republic, and our admiration for the courage with which Colombians are tackling this problem.\\nThe political climate that now prevails is perhaps the most propitious in four decades for the successful initiation and implementation of undertakings necessitating the willingness of Governments to co-operate with each other. Ideological dogmatism and political inflexibility appear to be losing ground in the face of realism and common sense. Over the last few months, we have embarked on a new era of dialogue and collaboration, which has translated into a cessation of hostilities, the reaching of agreements, and the establishment of contacts and channels of communication. All of this has led to the solution, or imminent solution, of several regional conflicts.\\nThe cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq; the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan that has already taken place; the recent efforts to normalize the situation in Kampuchea; the December 1988 agreements on southern Africa and the beginning of the self-determination process in Namibia; the agreements on New Caledonia; the contacts concerning Western Sahara; the new surge in the Central American peace process following the regional presidential summit last August; and the promising resumption of dialogue between Argentina and the United Kingdom with a view to settling their differences directly - these are manifestations of this desire for peace, and proof of the sterility and futility of confrontation, intolerance and misguided nationalism.\\n\\nThis new spirit is evident also in the changes introduced by numerous countries in the principles and objectives of their domestic policies, which have led them to greater openness, both internally and externally, thereby strengthening the prospects for international peace and co-operation. 1 am referring to political evolution on the domestic front in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, as well as to the steps taken towards democracy by the last authoritarian regimes in South America, which are evidence of a less dogmatic political vision that, fortunately, appears to be spreading in almost all regions of the world.\\nHowever, there remain areas in which the voices of peace go unheeded, First, the human-rights situation in the world is still far from satisfactory. The international community knows that the important progress made in the political field will remain precarious while vast sectors of the world's peoples are unable fully to enjoy their human rights.\\nThere can be no doubt whatsoever that no progress - whether economic, social, political or moral — will have a firm foundation so long as any vestiges of racism and racial discrimination remain, and in particular while practices such as apartheid continue. South Africa's persistence in disregarding the resolutions of the United Nations will not stifle the persistence of the rest of the world in reclaiming for that country the full force of the equality and dignity of the human race.\\nThe work of the United Nations in developing human rights and establishing the means of guaranteeing respect for them must continue, with the support of the international community. A very important step has been taken with the drafting of the convention on the rights of the child, which we trust will soon become, for every State, the appropriate ethical and legal framework for improving the status of children.\\nThe Middle East conflict continues to threaten world peace and to cost the parties involved a high price in human life and in moral and material damage. Nevertheless, signals are beginning to come from both sides - signals that are helping to generate the climate necessary for a negotiated solution. For Israel, this would mean lasting peace within safe borders, and, for the Palestinians, the possibility of exercising freely their right to self-determination.\\nIn this region, we are also particularly concerned about the tragic situation in Lebanon - a country with which we have many links, and whose long-suffering people are the victims of an unjust and senseless war, with the Resulting death and devastation with which we are all too familiar.\\nUruguay has raised its voice in the past, and does so again, to call on all the parties involved to intensify their efforts to achieve a final solution to the conflict. This implies the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese territory and the harmonization, by democratic means, of domestic differences. In this regard, we wish every success for the mediation undertaken by several heads of State of the League of Arab States. We trust that the pursuit of peace in Lebanon will succeed and that this country will once again be as prosperous and peaceful as it once was.\\nThese problems, as well as other situations that threaten peace, are this year, as in previous years, difficult challenges to which the General Assembly should respond by trying to reconcile the specific interests of each nation with\\nthe general interests of the international community. We are aware that this is a task fraught with difficulties, but at the same time we are encouraged because we know, Mr. President, that under your enlightened and expert direction, we shall achieve the desired results.\\nI should like to conclude by expressing our sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his intelligent and effective presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session, and also to the Secretary-General, whose dynamism, tact and commitment have strengthened the role of his office within the Organization and have been an essential factor in enhancing its prestige through his successful intervention in the peaceful solution of a number of regional conflicts.\\n  \n",

The unanimity of that decision reflects not only your own distinguished record as Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative of your country to the United Nations but also the prestige of your country, Nigeria, of which all of us in Africa are proud.\\nThe outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, shouldered the responsibility of his office with distinction in a momentous and difficult year. We wish to acknowledge our debt to him.\\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, has been at the head of our Organization during some of its roost troubled and also some of its most productive and successful years. The turnaround in the fortunes of the United Nations during his watch owes much to the skill of the helmsman and we want to reassure him of our continued confidence.\\nThe current session of the General Assembly must seriously address itself to problems affecting the world economy. In the vital field of international economic relations, the fresh breeze that has led to such excitement in international political relations has not even made a ripple. The direction of the world economy is still determined by a small circle of rich and powerful nations for which short-term expediency and the requirements of individual national economies have all too often taken precedence over the steps required for a healthier world economy from which all States would benefit in the long run. For the smaller countries the result has been a collapse in commodity prices causing severe prejudicial terms of trade, where several times the volume and quality of produce is now required to purchase the same amount of manufactured goods from the North than was required only a few years ago. In addition, the necessary borrowing on the part of the developing countries, coupled with high interest rates, has resulted in a debilitating debt-service burden for those countries that has culminated in a net reverse transfer of resources from South to North in the order of nearly $50 billion annually according to the calculations of international financial institutions. Fifty billion dollars annually is a very big amount to owe and we ate informed that more money is still continuing to flow from the developing countries to the developed countries. \\nHow can we, in all conscience, talk of kinder, gentler times and continue to countenance the continual transfer of such a phenomenal amount of resources from the poor and the hungry to the rich and the affluent? We welcome the positive developments on the international political stage and we believe that all peoples should enjoy political and civil rights. Conscience, however, enjoins us to submit that these rights are not enough. People have economic and social rights as well: the right to good health, the right to food and shelter, and above all the tight to a decent standard of living. It should be the lot of no one to suffer the degradations of illiteracy and poverty. Hunan rights are a package the elements of which are mutually reinforcing, and the denial of any of them weakens the entire package. A poor man, a sick man and an illiterate man are just as manacled as the man who is denied individual freedom or the right of free speech. It is the package that is important, for it goes beyond the selective, and at times cynical, championing of this or that right to the core of the purpose of existence·, the tight to a decent and meaningful life. Any attempt to separate one from the other or to compartmentalize these rights and champion one right at the expense of the other is to sow confusion and set the stage for futile recriminations.\\nAll States represented in the Assembly should subscribe to that view and attempt to pursue the objective of a good and decent existence for all human beings. The pursuit of a healthier world economy, of growth and development of the poorer countries and of fairer terms of trade between the North and the South is fundamentally a struggle for human rights and for the tight of people to a decent existence.\\nIn our interdependent world that struggle must involve a concerted approach, including greater recourse to multilateral mechanisms on the part of all States. Nations must act together to solve the global and interrelated problems of the world economy, as low commodity prices, high interest rates and acute external Indebtedness. The politics of inclusion that appear to be gaining ground in international political relations, particularly through professions by the big Powers of their readiness to give a larger role in the management of international affairs to the United Nations, should also be reflected in international economic relations.\\nThe initiative taken by the developing countries in urging the Assembly to hold a special session on economic co-operation, in particular for the revitalization of the growth and development of developing countries, in April 1990, is a timely development. The special session should focus on the need to renew the stalled North-South dialogue and on the direction of the world economy. I am pleased to note that the recent summit Conference of the Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, held at Belgrade, endorsed this suggestion and all the member States of the Non-Aligned Movement will be co-operating in the exercise. In this era, when economic mega-blocs are in the process of being formed in North America and in Europe, and where East and West are drawing closer in many spheres, it is essential that developing countries are not left out of the discussions and the mechanisms that will affect the future course of international economic and political relations. We also note that preparations are under way for the elaboration of the international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. We wish to stress the complementarity we see between that process and next year's special session on economic co-operation, to which I have already referred.\\nFollowing the 1986 special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa, the Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. That Programme represented a compact between the African countries and the international community, especially the donor countries. The African countries were to take steps to redress their economies through structural adjustment programmes, which they have done - often at a significant social and political cost - and the international community undertook to create an international environment conducive to African recovery by facilitating an increase in commodity prices and resource 21ows to the continent. The mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme, annexed to resolution 43/27 of 1988, clearly states that the international community has not kept its side of the bargain. The African States have made the adjustments that were required of them. Let me echo the words of Mr. Michael Manley, Prime Minister of Jamaica, when he sand recently: ,We have done everything that was asked of us. But what has the other side done?, \\nCommodity prices have continued to fall and resource flows to Africa have not increased in any appreciable way. Given the sacrifices the African countries have made to keep their part of the bargain, it is important that the Programme be made o work. Since the review of the Programme will take place in 1991, and the programme itself is to run only up to 1990, it is important that the Programme be mandated to run until the final review, and we hope that decision will be taken at this session. \\nProblems of the environment affect the entire globe, which is our common abode, and many speakers have referred to this important factor. From the depletion of the ozone layer to the poisoning of the atmosphere and the rivers, the degradation of the environment affects all of us. The global warming of the general climate affects com tries in Europe, in the Americas, Africa and everywhere. For us in Africa the problem of the environment is important as we face what one representative has described here as the encroaching deserts. We have heard from many delegations of the encroachment of the desert on to their own fertile lands. We also have the related problem of the dumping of nuclear and toxic wastes which have been the subject of resolutions by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the International Atomic Energy Agency and the General Assembly itself, last year. Greater responsibility is needed in the way the world uses its natural resources and disposes of the dangerous waste products of its factories. In the last year representatives will have read press reports about the very dangerous dumping of wastes in certain African countries, which action was rightly condemned by the OAU and other internal forums. We therefore welcome the intention to hold a special international conference on the environment in 1992. \\nWe are also aware that all too often the weak ate made to pay for the sins of the strong - if only because controlling the strong is so much more difficult. It is important that the burden attendant upon safeguarding the environment should be shared judiciously according to resource usage, waste production and need. Particularly, it is essential that no new obstacles are put in the path of the economic progress of the developing countries, which are already at the receiving end of the imbalances and inequities of the present international economic order and of the abuse and misuse of the international environment. \\nRespect for the right of peoples to self-determination and independence is not only just? it is also good politics and essential to the attainment and maintenance of world peace. The General Assembly clearly recognized that fact when it adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples way back in December 1960. Yet today, nearly three decades later, colonialism is still very much in evidence. Again, that is a practical reality of our times. The right of peoples to decide their own destiny is being denied not only in the well-publicized cases of southern Africa and the Middle East, especially Palestine, but also in countries in the Pacific, the Caribbean basin and elsewhere. \\nHowever, the major issue facing the Organization this year is the decolonization of Namibia. That is as it should be. The birth of a new nation is a supreme event in international affairs. And when the United Nations is the appointed intermediary the event becomes even more special to all of us. We ate now entering the horns stretch in the implementation of the Namibian independence plan. Much ground has already been covered and much reference has been made to this phenomenon in speeches we have heard in the last two weeks. But a lot more still remains to be done in the remaining four-and-a-half weeks. Pretoria and its functionaries in Namibia are still refusing fully to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the South West Africa Territory (SWATP) command structure has not been disbanded, end we are told that it has only been stood down  the so-called disbandment of Koevoet on 30 September has proved to be illusory  restrictive laws, in particular AG-23, continue to inhibit freedom of assembly and the registration, electoral and constituent Assembly proclamations leave much to be desired. These proclamations were affected only last week, end more information is still being given as to what exactly has been agreed to. Some improvements have been made, some changes have been recorded, and we commend the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) for this, but we need to be vigilant and to ensure that in the next four-and-a-half weeks nothing will be done to reverse the clock. Intimidation of followers of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) by the South-African-sponsored Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) end the South West African Police is regularly reported. In fact, if members read Namibian newspapers they will find they ate full of reports of attacks on SWAPO men and supporters, at times with the police just standing by. UNTAG police units are stretched to the breaking-point we are told, and the assassination of SWAPO leaders has actually taken place.\\nSo, while we ate on the home stretch, a grave situation still surrounds events in Namibia, and it is important that we should all keep our guard and remain vigilant. As we enter these final weeks of the election campaign the desperation of the anti-SWAPO forces in Namibia is becoming evident daily. It is important, therefore, that urgent action be taken to strengthen UNTAG police units and to increase the number of projected electoral monitors. We are very pleased that a number of States represented here have agreed and are going to send observers, monitors and guests to Namibia over the next few weeks to observe what will be happening. The more observers, the more guests, the more people we can have in that country, the better. We welcome the effort being made by many States around the globe.\\nMeanwhile, the United Nations must prepare well-thought-out plans for the post-election period in Namibia, assuming the election proceeds satisfactorily. For there can be no doubt that, as the decolonizing authority, the United Nations has a continuing responsibility to see that Namibia's independence is a success. A good mother does not give birth only to abandon the baby immediately. This session of the General Assembly must ensure that the United Nations prepares itself to be a good mother. My delegation is ready to contribute in the process of clarifying the united Nations role during the transition period following the elections and in the elaboration of a continuing United Nations responsibility to ensure that Namibian independence is a success. These are urgent tasks which require our immediate attention. Every effort has been made to draw the attention of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the United Nations generally to these natters, especially the question of convening the Assembly after the elections. Whoever wins the election, it is not yet clear how the Assembly will be convened and how it will proceed to draw up the constitution leading to independence. We would be pleased if the United Nations would remain seized of these problems and would continue to provide solutions until the time of independence itself.\\nIn South Africa itself, apartheid, the root cause of all the problems in southern Africa, continues to be firmly entrenched. The state of emergency still continues  Mandela and other political prisoners remain incarcerated j liberation and mass democratic movements ant still proscribed·, the Group Areas Pet and other obnoxious legislative acts continue to be on the apartheid statute books. That is the reality of the situation in South Africa itself.\\nPresident de Klerk's talk of reform so far remains only mere talk. It is important that the Pretoria regime be urged to go beyond rhetoric to concrete action. The liberation movements are ready to engage President de Klerk in serious negotiations. They have formulated an imaginative negotiating platform which was adopted by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, in Harare, on 21 August 1989, as well as by the ninth non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade, It is on the table for South Africa to take advantage of. This is an olive branch from the liberation movement. It outlines a number of confidence-building measures needed before negotiations can begin and sets out the fundamental human rights that should guide the formulation of a new constitutional dispensation for a future South Africa. It is quite obvious of course that negotiations, or any form of dialogue, cannot take place while the leaders are incarcerated in gaols or while the present restrictions emanating from the state of emergency remain. The international community has warmly welcomed this important initiative for peace to which I have just referred, taken by the liberation movement. So far Pretoria has remained mum on this proposal. We are told that certain of the seven leaders who are now incarcerated nay be released sooner or later. That might be a palliative, but what we need is a complete and full constitutional dispensation that can being peaceful conditions in which negotiations can truly take place for the future of an independent South Africa.\\nUntil Pretoria dismantles apartheid it is important that the international community intensifies its pressure on it and increases the sanctions against it. There is no secret about the fact that Pretoria is now talking reform is directly related to the impact of international sanctions and the pressure exerted by the liberation forces and other democratic forces in South Africa. There is no doubt whatsoever that sanctions are working and can continue to work. They have damaged the South African economy to a great extent, as has been admitted by the economic spokesmen for that regime. Therefore, more sanctions will certainly put more pressure on the regime. The medicine is slowly taking effect. We appeal to those friends of Pretoria who oppose sanctions to join the rest of the international community in bringing meaningful pressure to bear on Pretoria by applying sanctions and supporting the liberation movement.\\nTo the international banking community we say that 1990 will be a critical year for the apartheid regime, because in that year it has to reschedule its debt. Rescheduling the debt is not an automatic right for the racist regime let it be a favour, granted as an inducement to meaningful change in South Africa. The concatenation of events makes the coming rescheduling exercise a particularly potent force for positive political developments in South Africa. We urge the bankers to use it. We have given them adequate information to ensure that they ace quite clear about the choices before then.  \\nElsewhere in southern Africa, there are regional efforts to bring peace to Angola and to Mozambique. The Assembly has heard statements by the Foreign Ministers of both those countries, elaborating on those measures. We in Zimbabwe appeal to outsiders to stop supporting rebel elements in Mozambique and Angola, especially UNITA in Angola, which has created difficulties in the process of reconciliation. We are seeking African solutions to African problems. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations can help as requested and as required, but we ask them to give these initiatives a chance.\\nWe also seek peace efforts in the dispute between Mauritania and Senegal, the situation in the Sudan and the situation in Ethiopia. African solutions, initiated by the OAU, are at work in those situations, and we again appeal to outsiders not to interfere in the processes of reconciliation that ate taking place. We are satisfied that the initiatives taken by the Organization of African Unity, if given time to mature, will provide solutions and bring peace to the three areas I have mentioned.\\nWe are also anxious to see Western Sahara's independence consolidated with speed and firmness. The Secretary-General's efforts to bring permanent peace to Western Sahara are commended. We also commend the meetings that took place earlier this year between the King of Morocco and the POLISARID Front. We hope these efforts will continue.\\nThe denial of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination is a continuing sore in international relations. We deplore the heavy-handed methods of the occupation forces against the aggrieved heroic Palestinian nation. We wish to reiterate our conviction that only an international peace conference under United Nations auspices, with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as an equal partner are addressing all aspects of the Middle East crisis, can bring peace to the region. The proclamation of a Palestinian State last year was an important development in this area. We commended, and commend, the PIO for the step it took, and we are pleased that over 85 countries have recognized the Palestinian State. From that strong position, the Palestinian leadership should be able to proceed to meaningful negotiations with big Powers, small Powers and others in the region that are seized of the problem of Palestine. The independence of Palestine has been long delayed, and we should like to see the Palestinian people take their place as equal citizens alongside the peoples of other nations.\\nIn Central America, we welcome the decision to disband the contras and the scheduled elections in Nicaragua, which are to be monitored by the Organization of American States, the United Nations and a host of other international observers. We are pleased that a dialogue has resumed between the Salvadorian Government and the Marti National Liberation Front aimed at bringing peace to El Salvador. We urge flexibility on both sides so that a peaceful solution can be found to their conflict. The only warning we as outsiders would issue regarding the Central American situation again takes the form of urging outsiders not to interfere in the processes that are taking place there. The effort being made by the leaders of Central America to corns together and produce plans that enable them to enjoy self-determination and full human rights and provide peace for their own territories is commendable - if only outsiders do not interfere. In that respect, the main instigator of problems that have arisen in Central America is, of course, the United States, which has continued to fail in troubled waters in Latin America. \\nIn Afghanistan, we again urge all outside Powers to stop supplying arms to the opposing sides, and we call upon the Afghan people to negotiate an end to their civil war in a spirit of national reconciliation. We are pleased to note the departure of Soviet troops, and we are also pleased to note the confidence and patriotism that act brought to the Afghan people themselves. We hope that sooner or later they will convene a shura - an assembly - that will make it possible for all Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan to get together to resolve their problems. We believe all Afghans can solve their problems in peace in a shura, their traditional assembly which had met periodically over the past 300 or 400 years.\\nOn the question of Kampuchea, we welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and urge the parties concerned to negotiate their differences among themselves in order to arrive at an acceptable solution. We noted with disappointment the failure of the recent Paris Conference. We also noted with disappointment that both the Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh delegations to that Conference refused to accept the international mechanism that was suggested a United Nations peace-keeping force. We have made it clear to them, and we make it clear now, that we do not see any possibility of disarming the rival forces, bringing peace to Cambodia and holding elections there without the active participation of the United Nations. The United Nations has much experience with peace-keeping forces around the world, and, in our view, is the only organization that can assist in the peace-making and peace-keeping process. \\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula, it is our view that the Korean people should be left alone to negotiate their reunification without outside interference. We urge that the military manoeuvres by outside forces that often take place on the peninsula or in waters near it be stopped.\\nWith regard to Cyprus we appeal again to both parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the search for a lasting solution. We commend the meetings that have taken place under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General between the President of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish Cypriots. Again, we call on outside Powers to cease interfering in the internal affairs of Cyprus.\\nIn Belgrade the leaders of the non-aligned countries called for self-determination for the remaining colonies of New Caledonia, Malvinas, Diego Garcia, Mayotte and a dozen other territories scattered across the globe. The forty-third session of the General Assembly declared an International Decade for the eradication of the retrograde system of colonialism. We repeat that call from this rostrum.\\nAs can be seen from the problems I have just touched upon, we have not yet readied the Promised Land, the new detente notwithstanding. Much remains to be done, and in that the United Nations must play a central role. We therefore welcome the declarations that have be τ made from this podium by the great Powers, renewing their faith in the United Nations. These days of change also mean a period of uncertainty, a period of opportunities, yet also of danger. In such a period, recourse to and respect for the Organization and its agencies becomes more indispensable than ever before.\\nIt was in recognition of that fact, and motivated by the desire to strengthen peace and the rule of law, as well as to bring the age of reason to international relations, that the non-aligned countries convened at The Hague, from 26 to 30 June 1989 a Conference on Pace and the Rule of law in International Affairs. We were pleased by the wide attendance at that Conference, which included important countries not members of our Movement. The Conference was a landmark in the struggle to bring the rule of law and the role of the World Court to the centrality they should enjoy in the resolution of conflicts and in the management of international relations. An important initiative was taken at the Conference to have the General Assembly declare at its current session a decade of international law from 1990 to 1999, leading to a third Hague Peace Conference. That is one of the concrete acts that can be achieved at this session of the General Assembly in the cause of peace, justice and the rule of law. We urge all Member States to support that noble initiative by the non-aligned countries. I am informed that a concrete proposal has already been submitted to the Sixth Committee and that it is now being debated.\\nLast - but by no means least - is the all-important issue of nuclear disarmament, to which I have not referred extensively in my statement. We have all had the opportunity to welcome the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in 1987. That was a truly significant step in the right direction, but what remains to be achieved is even more formidable. In comparison to that, the INF Treaty is indeed only the tip of the iceberg. The super-Powers have a special responsibility in this regard. As the possessors of the largest arsenals of nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction, they have a duty to take the lead in the disarmament process.\\nBut of course we of the non-aligned movement, as well as the Organization of African Unity, can take some credit for the fact that at the special session of the General Assembly convened last year to discuss the question of disarmament we made our position abundantly clear. We indicated the hazards of war with which the road to disarmament is replete, and we are pleased that our call has been heeded in some quarters.\\nToday the world still has many problems, but in 1989 there is a window of opportunity to address some of them. History will judge us harshly if we miss that opportunity.\\n  "

       "      <td>Let me begin, Sir,\\nby paying tribute to your predecessor, Jean Ping, for\\nhis extraordinary work — above all on the world\\nsummit, but also throughout his year as President —\\nand by offering my congratulations to you on\\nbeginning your year in office.\\nI should also like to express, on behalf of the\\nEuropean Union and all its member States, our deepest\\nsympathy and solidarity to the people of the United\\n27\\n\\nStates, particularly those in the Gulf states, in their\\nhour of need.\\nIn early July, my first duty in the presidency of\\nthe European Union was to go to Srebrenica to mark\\nthe tenth anniversary of the massacre there, the worst\\nin Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\nMore than 8,000 people, mainly Muslim, were taken\\naway and killed as the international community just\\nstood to one side. To be sure, we had shown the right\\nconvictions in words, but shamefully, we had failed to\\nact. The lesson of that massacre — and of the even\\ngreater horror of Rwanda a year before — was that we\\nall needed better means to turn our collective will into\\ndecisive action. I think that we in the European Union\\nhave learned in the intervening period. Today, the\\nUnion is on the ground as a military, police or civilian\\npresence in Bosnia, in Aceh, in Iraq, in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo and, with the African Union, in\\nDarfur.\\nI also think that the United Nations has learned\\nthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit this\\nweek, we agreed on the further steps that we need to\\ntake for the Organization to be even more effective. Of\\nall that was agreed at the summit, I believe it will be\\nthe agreement on our “responsibility to protect” that\\nwill be seen in the future as having the greatest\\nsignificance of all. If we follow through on the\\nresponsibility to protect, then never again will\\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\\nhumanity be allowed to take place under our noses\\nwith nothing done.\\nThe responsibility to protect is, of course, a\\nreflection of our common morality. But it is also a\\nrecognition that the world in which we now live is too\\nsmall for us to be unaffected by, or indifferent to, the\\ninnocent victims of murder and oppression. This\\nshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it has\\nbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell, a generation\\nof ideological certainties was swept away. People could\\nsuddenly see partners where before they had only\\nglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrier\\nwas noisily being breached, a revolution in information\\ntechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distance\\nand time. Continents and cultures are now cabled\\ntogether and bound by trade and services in a way that\\nwas unimaginable even a decade ago.\\nIn this new world, we can no longer safely\\ntolerate the general threat that can come from a\\nparticular human tragedy, wherever it takes place. To a\\ngreater extent than ever before, we share the same\\nworld: the same threats and responsibilities, the same\\nopportunities and interests. And precisely because the\\nboundaries of our world have contracted, the\\nhorizons — the ambitions — of many people around\\nthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time in\\nour history, mankind has the ability to realize the\\npotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and in\\nevery region through an open exchange of goods,\\ninvestment, technology and, above all, ideas.\\nNot least in all of this, it is the rise of India and\\nof China that is reordering the world economy.\\nHundreds of millions there and elsewhere have been\\nlifted out of poverty. A new global market has been\\ncreated that ignores the divide — which seemed so\\nfundamental for so many decades — between East and\\nWest.\\nCurrently, not everyone has the chance to share in\\nall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remains\\nblighted by poverty, disease and conflict. The\\nEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable to\\nachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief, trade\\nreform and development aid are all vital, but none of\\nthem can work alone. Fundamental to making poverty\\nhistory are the Governments of the developing world\\nthemselves. And where Governments fail, their own\\npeoples are the victims, as United Nations Special\\nEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka’s damning assessment of the\\nsituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.\\nSub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet to\\nachieve its potential. The American author Thomas\\nFriedman, in his recent book The World Is Flat,\\nhighlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arab\\npeoples whose forebears devised algebra and the\\nalgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based,\\nbut those peoples are now right at the rear of today’s\\ntechnological revolution, with, for example, fewer than\\n2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.\\nThree United Nations Development Programme Arab\\nHuman Development Reports have now set out clearly\\nhow limited economic prospects and stunted political\\nfreedoms have led young and talented people towards\\nalienation and disillusionment.\\nThe answer, however, does not lie in easy\\nstereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is only\\nthe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us to\\nbelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally\\n28\\n\\ndifferent. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust and\\ndespair, and we reject it utterly. Indonesia and\\nTurkey — to name just two — are both striking\\nexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslim\\npopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.\\nWe in the European Union have seen the vibrant\\nMuslim communities in our own countries, and from\\nthat experience have seen how Islamic and Western\\ncultures can be partners in a global society.\\nEveryone knows that the Arab peoples want\\nprosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much\\nas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that the\\nArab world has the lowest scores in regional\\nmeasurements of democratic practices, civil freedoms\\nand good governance is not some cultural inevitability,\\nbut a temporary failure of human will. In that regard,\\nthe international community has a clear responsibility\\nto encourage regionally led political, social and\\neconomic reform. The European Union strongly\\nsupports such reform and will continue to do so.\\nEqually, it has been our active foreign policy that has\\nplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran, especially on\\nthe nuclear dossier.\\nWith our High Representative Javier Solana and\\nmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues,\\nwe have made detailed proposals for the relationship\\nbetween the European Union and Iran to be based on\\ncooperation and respect for international norms and\\ntreaties.\\nOur proposals envisage a high-level, long-term\\npolitical and security framework between the European\\nUnion and Iran, in which we would work together in\\npolitical, economic, scientific and technological areas,\\nincluding the civil nuclear field, in return for Iran\\nproviding guarantees about its intentions and\\ncapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So, we will\\nlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon’s\\nspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic of\\nIran, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\\nOn Iraq, the European Union now has a\\ncomprehensive programme of engagement and has put\\nbehind it divisions over the military action two and a\\nhalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of a\\npeaceful, prosperous, democratic and stable nation.\\nWe are also giving very active support to the\\nQuartet’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace\\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, with two States\\nliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon’s\\nbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and\\nwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas’s work to build\\nthe first stage of an effective, viable State of Palestine.\\nIn July, the European Union again suffered the\\nhorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the target\\nwas my country, the United Kingdom: its capital,\\nLondon. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.\\nInternational terrorism requires an international\\nresponse; otherwise, we all pay the price for each\\nother’s vulnerabilities. The ratification of a\\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism is, therefore, at the\\nhighest priority.\\nBut the threat from terrorists and the political\\ninstability they bring is made worse by the easy\\navailability of weapons in what has become an\\nanarchic, unregulated international trade. These same\\nweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia a\\ndecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.\\nWe already have international instruments to regulate\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We in the\\nEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms control\\nregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that the\\ntime has now come for this Organization to embrace\\nthe idea of an international arms trade treaty, which\\nwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.\\nIt was in the killing fields of Europe, in two\\nsuccessive wars, that the twin ideas of the United\\nNations and of the European Union became imperative.\\nToday, the European Union’s commitment to the\\nUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.\\nAnd it is reflected in what we give in voluntary\\ndonations and to the regular budget and peacekeeping\\noperations.\\nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations\\nremains today what it was at its foundation: to remove\\nthe scourge of war, to reaffirm the worth of the human\\nperson and to promote social progress and better\\nstandards of life. In this changed and changing world,\\nit is the responsibility of us all to ensure that this\\nOrganization has the powers and the resources to\\nachieve all these aims.</td>\n",

       "      <td>﻿I begin by paying a tribute to Dr.\\nAkila Al-Hashimi, a senior member of the Iraqi\\nGoverning Council, who died earlier today.\\nI had the privilege of meeting Dr. Al-Hashimi\\nearlier this year in London and later in Baghdad, and I\\nwas struck by her courage and her dedication to the\\nIraqi people. Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by those\\nwho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic,\\nprosperous future they so richly deserve. The best\\nservice that we can render her memory is to defeat the\\nterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful,\\nfree Iraq prevails.\\nOf course, we owe this service to all those who\\nhave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieira\\nde Mello and the United Nations personnel who were\\nkilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 August\\nwere committed to bringing the ideals of the United\\nNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimate\\nsacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss, but\\nwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqi\\npeople rebuild their country on the principles of justice\\nand security.\\nWhat, I think, makes Iraq so important was the\\nway in which it tested the role and purpose of this\\ninstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughout\\nthat period, the international community remained in\\nagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a\\nChapter VII threat to international peace and security\\nby its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will of\\nthe United Nations. Yet, earlier this year, sadly, we\\ndivided on when and what action was necessary to deal\\nwith the Iraqi threat.\\nOf course, I acknowledge the controversy over\\nthe military action which the United Kingdom, the\\nUnited States and others took and the heavy\\nresponsibilities we now bear, but I firmly believe that\\nthe decisions we took were the right ones. The\\nauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Having\\ngiven Saddam Hussein’s regime a final opportunity to\\ncomply with the United Nations, what would have\\nhappened if we had simply turned away? Would the\\nworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a better\\nplace today? Would the United Nations be a stronger\\ninstitution today? The answer to each of those\\nquestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have been\\nemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator would\\nhave been encouraged to follow his example; and the\\nauthority of this United Nations would have been\\ngravely weakened.\\nYet, whatever the arguments of the spring, we\\nhave now to come together again for a common\\npurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in its\\nthree resolutions 1472 (2003), 1483 (2003) and 1500\\n(2003), we have a shared interest in helping Iraqi\\ncitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which they\\nhave been denied so long and for which this institution\\nwas founded. Yes, the security situation does present\\nformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedom\\nare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They have\\ninflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people, coalition\\nsoldiers and international aid workers, but ultimately\\nthey will fail.\\nAnd let us also not lose sight of what has been\\nachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein’s\\nreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture and\\noppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of\\n31\\n \\nlives is at an end. Instead, we have the beginnings of a\\nrepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;\\nnew ministries providing daily services to the people; a\\nfree press; the freedom for members of all religious\\ncommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals and\\nschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets and\\nhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.\\nWe shall stay in Iraq as long, but only as long, as\\nit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and to\\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as we\\ncan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we can\\nagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthen\\nthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing this\\ntransition, we should be guided by three central\\nprinciples: first, the transfer of powers must reflect\\nrealities on the ground in Iraq, particularly the need to\\nensure security; secondly, the Iraqi institutions must be\\nsufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;\\nand thirdly, the exercise of executive powers and\\nresponsibilities must be based on good governance,\\ninvolving representative Iraqi authorities and coherent\\nconstitutional arrangements. In other words, the timetable\\nshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and their\\ncapacity progressively to assume democratic control,\\nrather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.\\nIraq is, sadly, not the only territory in the Middle\\nEast where the international community faces great\\nchallenges. Three months ago, we all had high hopes\\nabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations,\\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and the\\nUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It is\\ntragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 August\\nby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem, which came only\\na few hours after the terrorist atrocity against the\\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, but the international\\ncommunity has to stay united on both the means and\\nthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternatives\\nto the road map and there can be no alternatives to the\\noutcome the entire world wishes to see — two States,\\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and\\nsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to the\\nthousands who have died on both sides since the\\nbeginning of this appalling conflict.\\nThe breadth of the issues being tackled by the\\nUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates the\\ncontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-\\nTerrorism Committee has given the United Nations a\\nfocus for its work following  September two years\\nago, but we must now build upon that work, giving the\\nCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce the\\ncapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcome\\nterrorism.\\nWe also know that proliferation is one of the\\ngreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Much\\ngood work on proliferation is being done by United\\nNations agencies, particularly the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency, but it is extraordinary that the Security\\nCouncil itself has not addressed the issue of\\nproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement, it is\\ntime that it did.\\nProblems of internal conflict, on the other hand,\\nare regularly on the Security Council’s agenda. The\\nUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experience\\nin this area and has achieved great things in countries\\nas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone, but nation-\\nbuilding is a collaborative effort, requiring the\\nresources and commitment of Member States if the\\nUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. We\\ntherefore need new mechanisms to help prevent\\nconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.\\nWe must also make a real success of the\\nMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome the\\nsetback of Cancún and secure a positive outcome to the\\nDoha Round.\\nThese and other shared problems require\\ncollective responses, as our Secretary-General so\\neloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key to\\nthis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remains\\nan effective global forum capable of delivering results.\\nThe Secretary-General posed some difficult questions\\ntwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek the\\nadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals on\\nreform. I welcome, too, his parallel commitment to\\nmodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.\\nFor our part, the United Kingdom is committed to\\nmaking the Security Council more representative. The\\nissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger and\\nmore representative Council, however, will not of itself\\nmake it easier to make the tough choices which it has\\nto face so often. The most important ingredient is the\\npolitical will and determination of the members of the\\nCouncil to take effective action.\\nThe most important part of the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s speech on Tuesday was about the choices\\nnow confronting the United Nations. He was right\\nabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.\\n32\\n \\nDown one route lies a world in which the United\\nNations strengthens its role as the collective instrument\\nfor protecting our peace and security; down the other\\nroute lies a world in which collective action becomes a\\nsynonym for “inaction”. We must not take this second\\nroute. The Secretary-General’s speech was a challenge\\nto all of us. We all share a world in which international\\nterrorists strike down the innocent, regardless of faith\\nor nationality, and we are all less secure when weapons\\nof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do not\\nhave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism, while\\nproposing no multilateral means of confronting and\\ndealing with these threats.\\nThe British Government is profoundly\\ncommitted, as it always has been, to the ideals of the\\nUnited Nations. To us, the importance of this\\nOrganization has always been its ability to put those\\nhigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedly\\nwith the Secretary-General and the international\\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations retains\\nand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr. President, I\\noffer my congratulations and those of my country on\\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\\nits fifty-ninth session.\\nEighteen months ago, the United Nations faced\\ndivisions more serious than any since the Cuban\\nmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether\\nthe strength and unity which we had built up since the\\nend of the cold war could survive.\\nThen last year we watched, as Secretary-General\\nKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.\\nIn the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided\\nto follow our Secretary-Generalís directions. This\\nOrganization has not been plunged, as some predicted,\\ninto paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if\\nunspoken determination to make the United Nations\\nwork, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central\\ntask: to secure peace around the world.\\nOver the last 12 months we have dealt with new\\ncrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we\\nhave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government\\nand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great\\nLakes; mobilized international support for the new\\nIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important\\nsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they should\\nin the media ó Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste,\\nBougainville and Western Sahara.\\nWe have shown in those actions the unity of\\npurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our\\nhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.\\nAnd the search for consensus has not been confined to\\nthe Security Council.\\nI am proud that just a few months after the\\ndifficult times of early last year, France, Germany and\\nthe United Kingdom came together to work, as we\\ncontinue to do, on the Iran dossier before the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\\nI recognize, of course, the frustrations which all\\nof us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict,\\nwhere the clear path to peace set out in the road map\\nand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.\\nBut all in all we have shown the will to make collective\\naction work, though we know, too, that we need to go\\nfurther.\\nIn particular, we need to get better at tackling\\nthreats which have changed dramatically since the\\nfounding of the United Nations. Today the greatest\\nthreats to our security often come not from other\\nfunctioning sovereign States, but from terrorist\\norganizations, from failing States and from man-made\\nshocks to our environment like climate change, which\\ncan exacerbate State failure and breed internal\\ninstability.\\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General is\\npreparing its recommendations on ways to address the\\nvarious challenges. We should remember in all this that\\nwe have one great advantage. Though its institutions\\nand the founding text of the Charter has hardly\\nchanged in 60 years, the United Nations is not an\\norganization set in stone, but a set of living institutions\\nbased on a shared will to make collective security\\nwork. The United Nations has adapted in the past -\\nwith the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus\\non individual rights and the setting of global targets for\\n34\\n\\ndevelopment - and I am confident that it can adapt in\\nthe future.\\nOf course, institutional change is part of that. At\\nthe United Nations foundation, one eighth of its\\nmembers could expect to be elected members of the\\nSecurity Council at any one time. Today that\\nproportion is less than one eighteenth. The United\\nKingdom has long supported the case for expanding\\nthe Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for\\nincluding amongst the permanent members: Germany\\nand Japan, two countries which between them\\ncontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United\\nNations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire\\nworldís population; and Brazil, which just missed\\npermanent membership back in 1945.\\nBut we should not see an expansion of the\\nSecurity Council, or other institutional change, as a\\npanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common\\nunderstanding - the United Nations jurisprudence, if\\nyou like - and its operational effectiveness so that we\\ncan respond more quickly and more thoroughly to\\ntodayís new threats.\\nLet me highlight three areas which to me seem\\nparticularly important: first, our approach must be\\nbroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,\\nincluding poverty, disease and environmental\\ndegradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by\\nexpanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we\\nmust deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces\\nus all and everything for which we stand.\\nLet me now take these three points in turn. First,\\nthere is the need for a broader approach which\\naddresses the complex and interdependent nature of\\nsecurity today. Here, we have to do more to meet the\\nMillennium Development Goals and to promote\\nsustainable development, especially in Africa. We\\ncannot have security without development or\\ndevelopment without security.\\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his\\nspeech this week, we have to do more to entrench the\\nrule of law and justice, especially in States recovering\\nfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work\\non the Secretary-Generalís report during its Security\\nCouncil presidency next month.\\nWe could also use the United Nations better, to\\nagree to monitor and help implement globally accepted\\nnorms of good governance.\\nAnd we need to act together quickly on climate\\nchange, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our\\nworld in terms of stability and security. We have to\\nimplement Kyoto - and I greatly welcome what my\\ncolleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on\\nthat today - and agree to emission reductions beyond\\n2012.\\nMy second point is the need to build a new\\nconsensus on the scope of collective action. We all\\nrepresent independent, sovereign states. But even as we\\nfounded the United Nations we recognized that\\nsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nationís\\ngovernment: there to be respected, not abused, from\\neither without or within.\\nThe Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse\\nfrom without could be dealt with through the inherent\\nright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the\\nCharter. But it also said that an abuse from within\\nwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealt\\nwith by the Security Council, under the powers\\nenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the\\nCharter, and by the many conventions concluded\\nwithin the United Nations framework, including, for\\nexample, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer -\\nwe all said - could or should the world turn away\\nfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.\\nBut we have not always lived up to those high\\nexpectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia\\nten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to\\ndo so and to engage in situations of humanitarian\\ncatastrophe or grave violations of international\\nhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats\\nto international peace and security.\\nThe principle of non-interference has to be\\nqualified by a duty to protect, especially where\\nGovernments are failing in that duty.\\nWe therefore need, for example, to be ready to\\nsupport greater use by the Secretary-General of his\\npowers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats\\nto peace to the Security Council's attention. We have to\\nact quickly in response, because prevention is far better\\nthan cure. We should look to work more closely with\\nregional organizations, as we are doing with the\\nAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on\\nthe criteria as to when the international community\\nmight have to intervene with military force in extreme\\ncircumstances. We must get better at engaging for the\\nlong term in countries recovering from conflict,\\n35\\n\\ncoordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed\\npriorities.\\nMy third point is the urgent need to combat\\nglobal terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have\\nlearned anything in the three years since 11 September\\n2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate\\nin its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,\\nHindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion\\nor any religion, and of every or no shade of political\\nopinion, all have died through the terroristsí bullet or\\nbomb.\\nMy friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a\\nmoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible,\\nunspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that\\ntook place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears;\\nRussiaís tears are the worldís tears. We are all in the\\nfight against terrorism together.\\nToday in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to\\nwhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the\\nvictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts\\nand condolences are with the Government and people\\nof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims\\nof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping\\nIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.\\nOne of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held\\nhostage by terrorists who have already barbarically\\nmurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts\\nand prayers are with their families. We continue to do\\nall we can to secure Mr. Bigleyís release.\\nI know - how could I forget - that opinions\\nhave differed over the rightness of the military action\\ntaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no\\nnation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now\\noccurring there. For we all recognize that what is being\\nattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on\\nthe Iraqi people and on everything for which the\\nOrganization stands: safety, security and human rights.\\nWe have to come together to defeat the terrorists and\\ntheir despicable aims.\\nThe threat of terrorism confronts democratic,\\nproperly functioning States with an acute dilemma,\\nnamely, how to fight those who recognize none of the\\nvalues for which we stand while remaining true to\\nthose values. Our commitments under international\\nconventions express many of those values and the\\nimportance that we attach to them. But equally, those\\nconventions cannot be allowed to shelter those\\ninvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designed\\nto protect citizens from abuse by States, not by\\nterrorists.\\nThe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\\nRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear of\\npersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so\\nmany other nations have offered that protection when and\\nwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Convention\\nitself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does\\nnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a\\ncrime against humanity or other serious crime; nor\\ndoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary\\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\\nWe must never stoop to the level of the terrorist ó\\nto torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration ó\\nnor will any country within the European Union be\\nparty to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor\\nto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists\\nexploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not\\nthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall\\ntherefore be working closely with Russia on its\\nimportant draft Security Council resolution, to see how\\nbest we can prevent those who commit, support and\\nfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee\\nstatus to which they are not entitled. Along with the\\nRussian Federation and other partners in the Security\\nCouncil, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the\\nspeedier extradition of such individuals.\\nWe, the United Nations, have over the last year\\nbegun to show a new determination to come together\\nand to make collective action work. A year from now,\\nwe will meet again here to review the\\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\\nChallenges and Change, as well as the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals, and to set the United Nations\\nagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdomís\\nchairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on\\ntackling climate change and on Africa, on which the\\nIndependent Commission for Africa will be producing\\nrecommendations as to how best we can support the\\nradical agenda for change and development designed\\nby Africa itself through the New Partnership for\\nAfricaís Development and the African Union. Our\\npresidency of the European Union will help us to lead\\nefforts for a successful outcome in the Doha\\nDevelopment Round, and for building the European\\nUnionís crisis-management capabilities.\\nMore than ever, global security is our shared\\nresponsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to\\n36\\n\\nadapt to todayís threats and challenges, we must find\\nrenewed determination and political will to make\\ncollective security work. The United Kingdom is\\ndetermined to play its full part in that endeavour.</td>\n",

       "      <td>First, I would \\nlike to pay tribute to the work of the Secretary-General. \\nA former British Minister once said of the NATO \\nSecretary General that he should be more of a secretary \\nand less of a general. Kofi Annan has been more of \\neverything: more of a diplomat, more of a reformer and \\nmore of a moral voice of leadership in the world. \\n In a world shattered by conflict, the founders of \\nthe United Nations saw that only by coming together, \\nunited in support of larger freedom, could we build our \\nshared future. Today, when the world’s nations are \\neven more interdependent than they were in 1945, what \\ndoes it mean to stand, as they intended, united? At one \\nlevel it means taking action when things go wrong, \\nwhere there is an actual breakdown of security or a \\ndescent into violence or chaos. Today in particular, the \\nUnited Nations faces the challenges posed by multiple \\nupheavals and crises across the world. \\n In the Middle East the United Nations is playing \\na vital role in establishing stability in southern \\nLebanon. Troops from the European Union are \\ndeploying alongside those from the Middle East, Asia \\nand Africa. All Member States must meet their \\nobligations under Security Council resolutions 1701 \\n(2006), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), if we are to \\nenable Lebanon to be the proud, democratic and \\ndiverse nation that its people want it to be. \\n But we are all aware that this most recent conflict \\nin Lebanon had its roots in the continuing failure to \\nachieve a just solution to the Palestinian question. That \\nis why the United Kingdom has consistently argued \\nthat there can be no higher priority than reinvigorating \\nthe Middle East peace process. \\n In Iraq, Prime Minister Al-Maliki’s national \\nreconciliation plan can help leaders from all \\ncommunities come together. At this crucial juncture, \\nwe must all intensify our support. The International \\nCompact provides the right vehicle. It allows the Iraqi \\nGovernment to set its own vision and shows us how we \\ncan help turn that vision into a reality. \\n In Afghanistan, real progress has been made, with \\nthe United Nations taking a leading role in \\ncoordinating the international effort. But real \\nchallenges still lie ahead. NATO’s task of securing the \\nsouth of the country is far from easy. Soldiers from \\nmany NATO countries, not least my own, have given \\ntheir lives to provide a better future for the people of \\nAfghanistan. The Afghan Government and people, too, \\nwant security, development and good governance. The \\nUnited Kingdom and the international community are \\ndetermined to help them to achieve them. \\n We must show a similar shared determination in \\nurging the Government of Iran to address international \\nconcerns over its nuclear ambitions and its support for \\nterrorism. The proposals put forward by Britain, France \\nand Germany with China, Russia and the United States \\noffer a path for the Iranian Government to develop a \\nmore constructive relationship with the rest of the \\nworld and give Iran’s talented population the \\nopportunities and prosperity that is their right, \\nincluding, if they wish, a modern nuclear power \\nindustry. We want to be able to resume negotiations. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 20 \\n \\nIran knows what is required, and that the alternative is \\nincreasing isolation. \\n Darfur remains in crisis. I pay tribute to the \\nefforts of the African Union and its peacekeepers. \\nWednesday’s decision to extend their mandate averted \\na security vacuum. We must now strengthen the force \\nof the African Union Mission in the Sudan. But it can \\nonly be a temporary reprieve. We also need action \\nimmediately on the political and humanitarian front. \\nThose who have not signed the Darfur Peace \\nAgreement must do so. Those who have must abide by \\nits provisions. \\n To underpin that Agreement, we urgently need a \\ngreatly strengthened international presence on the \\nground, with the active engagement and support of \\nAsian and Muslim, as well as African, countries. That \\nis why the Security Council authorized the deployment \\nof United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur. I urge \\nPresident Bashir to extend the Sudan’s relations with \\nthe United Nations in a common purpose to bring \\nlasting peace and genuine stability to the whole of the \\nSudan. It is, above all, his responsibility. \\n The security challenges the world faces are real. \\nAs an international community we must deal with \\nthem. But standing united also requires us to take up a \\nsecond, deeper level of global responsibility, namely, \\ntackling the underlying problems that promote conflict \\nand underdevelopment. We must strive to promote \\nsound global values and to build multilateral systems \\nwithin which nations and individuals can cooperate, \\nco-exist and each achieve their potential. \\n Many representatives to the Assembly have \\nalready spoken of the need to accelerate progress \\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Progress on those Goals is a moral \\nimperative rooted in a concern for, and an \\nunderstanding of, our common humanity. But it is also \\na political imperative, because there will be no stability \\nand security in our global community while so many \\nmillions of men, women and children in that \\ncommunity face only a life of hunger, poverty, \\ninequality and disease. \\n The same is true for those whose lives are \\nshattered by conflict or blighted by injustice. The \\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \\nCouncil are new structures that give us new \\nopportunities and new impetus. At the same time, we \\nmust see a step change in efforts towards an \\ninternational arms trade treaty that will end the \\nirresponsible transfer of arms that fuel conflict and \\nfacilitate the abuse of human rights. That is why the \\nUnited Kingdom, with six other countries, will \\nintroduce a draft resolution in the First Committee to \\nestablish a process to work towards a legally binding \\ntreaty on the trade in all conventional arms. \\n Collectively, we have a responsibility to protect \\nhuman life and a duty to defend the international \\ninstitutions that help us as a community to achieve that \\ngoal. The answers lie not in division or in personal \\nattacks, but in the earnest and consistent pursuit of \\njustice and peace.  \\n Our collective responsibility to each other is \\nnowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed \\nby climate change. The British Prime Minister, Tony \\nBlair, made climate change one of our two G8 \\npriorities last year, alongside poverty reduction in \\nAfrica. When the Prime Minister appointed me as his \\nForeign Secretary, in May, he specifically charged me \\nwith putting climate security at the heart of our foreign \\npolicy. We will not solve that problem if we do not \\neach assume our share of the responsibility for tackling \\nit. Nobody can protect themselves from climate change \\nunless we protect each other by building a global basis \\nfor climate security. That goes to the heart of the \\nUnited Nations mission, and the United Nations must \\nbe at the heart of the solution. \\n To put it starkly, if we all try to freeride, we will \\nall end up in free fall, with accelerating climate change \\nthe result of our collective failure to respond in time to \\nthat shared threat that faces us all. Look just at the \\ndanger posed by rising sea levels. Potentially, that \\ncould cause massive damage to some of the key urban \\ncentres of our global civilization. London, Shanghai, \\nDhaka, Singapore, Amsterdam, Cairo and, yes, \\nManhattan are all at risk. That is why we must all — as \\nforeign ministers, heads of Government and heads of \\nState — be ready to do more, and do it more quickly. \\nOur climate presents us with an ever-growing threat to \\ninternational security. Dealing with climate change, by \\nboth adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to \\navert still greater damage, is no longer a choice, it is an \\nimperative. \\n We need common commitment and genuine \\naction. We must all be ready to find a way to get the \\nagenda moving beyond Kyoto. The Gleneagles \\ndialogue meeting in Mexico at the beginning of \\n \\n \\n21 06-53317 \\n \\nOctober will be one such opportunity, a chance for \\ndeveloped and developing countries to work together \\non that shared problem.  \\n If we do not act now, an unstable climate will \\nundermine our progress in all those other areas that \\nmatter to us, not least the Millennium Development \\nGoals themselves. Take one of the most basic needs of \\nall, water. Already perhaps two fifths of the world’s \\npopulation finds it hard to get the water they need. At \\nthe same time, many in the world rely on affordable \\nenergy to help lift themselves out of poverty — and, \\nindeed, perhaps to give them access to that water. But \\nthere is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by \\nburning fossil fuels, we accelerate climate change. That \\nmeans further disrupting water supplies. For some \\npeople who now have plenty of water it will mean new \\nshortages. For those who already have little, it will \\nmean less. In turn, everywhere less water means less \\nfood. \\n Let me give a specific example of that dilemma. \\nThe whole world, as well as the Chinese people, is \\nbenefiting from the great success of the Chinese \\neconomy. No one in China or elsewhere wants that \\ngrowth to stop. But it is based, in China as elsewhere, \\non a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are \\ncreating climate change. Yet China is a country already \\nvulnerable to climate change. The Chinese Government \\nknows that as the Himalayan glaciers melt and \\nagricultural land shrinks, crop yields will fall, fresh \\nwater will become more scarce and the economy itself \\nwill suffer, and with it the world’s economy. \\n All the nations of the Arctic Circle are being, and \\nwill be, affected by melting permafrost, with \\ndisruptions to infrastructure and to investment. The \\nVice-President of Palau has just given us a vivid \\ndescription of what the environment means for his \\nnation. We all share, to a greater or lesser extent, that \\nsame dilemma. If we do not act on climate change, we \\nrisk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and \\nsecurity we are seeking to achieve. That is why we \\nmust recognize that talk of having either a successful \\neconomy or a stable climate is a false choice. We must \\nwork together to find paths for economic growth that \\nwill protect our climate. The truth is that we already \\nhave much of the technology we need to move to a \\nlow-carbon economy. But we must now deploy it very \\nmuch more rapidly. What we do in the next 10 years \\nwill count the most.  \\n The former chief economist of the World Bank, \\nSir Nicholas Stern, will shortly publish one of the most \\nsignificant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the \\neconomic impacts of climate change itself. One of the \\nkey emerging findings of his work is that while it will \\nnot cost the Earth to solve climate change, it will cost \\nthe Earth, literally as well as financially, if we do not. \\n Moreover, if we learn to tackle climate change \\ntogether, we have an opportunity to build trust between \\nnations and to strengthen the multilateral system. But if \\nwe get it wrong, that trust will be further eroded. It is \\nthe developed, rich world that bears a large \\nresponsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas \\nemissions, but it is the poorest in our global \\ncommunity — those least able to bear it — who will \\nbear the brunt of climate insecurity. We all need to do \\nmore. But the rich world should of course continue to \\nlead the effort, applying the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibility, which must continue to be \\nour guide. In the joint endeavour which the United \\nNations represents there can be no more stark or more \\nurgent warning than that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is a great  honour to make my first speech to the General \\nAssembly. \\n The United Nations has a duty to lead the world \\nin addressing the shared threats and opportunities that \\ndominate our age, and it must do so in deed as well as \\nin word. That is why I want to use this platform to \\nexpress my admiration and support for United Nations \\nmissions around the world, from Lebanon to Liberia, \\nfrom Congo and Haiti to East Timor, which, even as we \\nmeet in New York this week, are saving lives and \\nspreading hope. \\n Since 1946, when the first meeting of the General \\nAssembly took place in London, the United Kingdom \\nhas been determined to fulfil its international \\nresponsibilities through the United Nations. The new \\nGovernment in the United Kingdom, under the \\nleadership of Gordon Brown, is proud to continue that \\ntradition, and I reaffirm our commitment today. \\n The focus at this session has been on immediate \\nand pressing issues. In the Middle East, we need urgent \\naction towards a two-State solution that addresses the \\nsecurity of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the \\nsame time.  \\n In Iraq, recent security gains can only be \\nsustained through continued support for the \\ndevelopment of the Iraqi security forces, through \\nnational reconciliation and through political support \\nfrom the whole region. \\n Our international community depends on \\nresponsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a \\nleading and respected country, it must cease its support \\nfor terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its \\ndefiance of three Security Council resolutions in \\nrespect of its nuclear programme. \\n In Zimbabwe, we need United Nations action to \\nsupport African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle \\nof economic and social devastation that now afflicts \\nthe country. \\n We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in \\nBurma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest, \\nencourage national dialogue and promote genuine \\nreconciliation. Let us today send a message to the \\nmonks on the streets of Burma: we support your \\ndemand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a \\nmessage from the monks on the streets of Burma: the \\nhuman desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or \\nreligion or region. It is good that the Burmese \\nGovernment has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the \\ncountry, but it is now vital that they use his presence \\nthere to start the process of reconciliation. \\n But as well as addressing the traumas of our \\nfellow citizens around the world, the United Nations \\nmust be the place where we address the longer-term \\nthreats. Today, I devote my speech to one of the great \\nthreats to stability and prosperity in the world: the \\nthreat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities \\nare not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. \\nInequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for \\nan open, global economy. It corrodes trust and respect \\nand reciprocity between nations. \\n The United Nations Charter talks of the \\n“sovereign equality of States”, and it also talks of the \\n“equal rights and dignity of men and women and of \\nnations large and small”. The principle of equality is \\nnowhere more evident than in the General Assembly \\nwhere all States have an equal voice. But in the world \\noutside this Hall, economic, social and political \\ninequalities within and between States persist and \\nworsen. We cannot stand united against the shared \\nthreats and opportunities in our world when we are so \\ndivided by economic and political disparities. So the \\nneed for Governments and international institutions to \\nreduce inequalities and promote our common humanity \\nis stark. \\n Traditionally, we have focused on the divide \\nbetween developed and developing nations. However, \\nthe growth rates in many developing countries are \\nfaster than in developed economies. That is the good \\nnews. But there remain around a billion people in the \\nworld   one sixth of its population   living in 58 \\ncountries, who have been left out of the story of human \\nprogress. This “bottom billion” have an average life \\nexpectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the \\nchildren in the bottom billion die before their fifth \\nbirthday, and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The \\ncountries that are home to the bottom billion saw their \\nnational incomes fall each year during the 1980s and \\n1990s. \\n Even where inequalities are narrowing between \\nnations, they are widening within them. According to \\nthe United Nations Development Programme, in 73 \\ncountries   containing 80 per cent of the world’s \\npopulation   economic inequality has risen in recent \\nyears. \\n Every nation represented here has responsibilities \\nto its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs \\nopen markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens \\nthrough democratic and transparent institutions, free \\nfrom corruption. It needs strong and effective \\neducation and health services open to all. \\n But national action is not enough. Because the \\ncauses of inequality cross national boundaries, we need \\ncooperation between nations, bilateral and multilateral, \\nled by the United Nations. \\n First, three quarters of the countries where the \\nbottom billion citizens reside have recent or current \\nexperience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to \\nextreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200,000 \\npeople are dead, 2 million are displaced and 4 million \\nare on food aid. As the international community, we \\ndecided on a course of action in Security Council \\nresolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: \\nan agreement on force composition, swift deployment, \\neffective protection of civilians on the ground and a \\npolitical process in which the legitimate grievance of \\nthe Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In \\nAfghanistan, one of the five poorest countries in the \\nworld, we need to back up military efforts to secure \\nsafe space with economic, social and political \\nreconstruction. \\n Beyond those crises, we also need to improve our \\ncapacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is \\nour vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical \\ndimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose \\neasy availability makes it so simple to set up militias \\nand provoke violence and mayhem. Last year, the \\nAssembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward \\nUnited Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see \\nresolution 61/89). The Government of the United \\nKingdom will continue to press for the achievement of \\nthat goal. \\n Secondly, freedom from conflict is the platform \\nfor progress, but the battle against disease and \\nilliteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some \\ncountries, the world is off track to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That is why, in July here \\nat the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the United \\nKingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own \\ncommitments and go further, to build a truly global \\npartnership   with the private sector, trade unions, \\nfaith groups, civil society and cities   that can meet \\nthe 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed \\nworld to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of \\nits national incomes on development. The United \\nKingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that \\nrequires shared responsibility. Poor governance and \\ncorruption are the enemies of development. \\n Thirdly, progress on aid needs to be combined \\nwith a new global trade deal that opens up economies \\non a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit \\nfrom subsidies and tariffs, particularly for agriculture. \\nHigher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor \\ncountries from diversifying their economies. That is a \\nbad deal for Western consumers, and it squeezes out \\nthe livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither \\nis it in rich countries’ financial self-interest, nor is it \\nfair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes \\nthat concluding the Doha trade round this year is not \\njust necessary, but also possible, and we will work to \\nachieve that goal. \\n Finally, we must address the greatest long-term \\nthreat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate \\nchange. Climate change affects all countries, but the \\npoorest countries   and the poorest people within \\nthose countries   will suffer the most disruption and \\ndevastation. I congratulate the President of the General \\nAssembly on choosing climate change as a central \\ntheme of this general debate. And I congratulate the \\nSecretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But \\nwe need more than debate. \\n The United Nations Framework Convention on \\nClimate Change is the only body that can conclude a \\nglobal agreement on climate change. Therefore, in the \\nnext two months we need an urgent agreement on the \\nsteps towards progress to be taken at the December \\nmeeting in Bali. Beyond that, we need a road map to \\nthe 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be \\nheld at Copenhagen in two years’ time, and agreement \\non a global deal that succeeds the end of the first \\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \\n At the heart of such an agreement must be the \\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities: \\nall countries taking on responsibilities, but making sure \\nthat they are equitably distributed, with the greatest \\naction taken by the richest countries. The United \\nKingdom stands ready to play its part. This year, our \\nclimate change bill will be enacted into law in the next \\nsession of Parliament to place on a statutory footing \\nour commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 \\nper cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we \\nneed similar binding commitments from all rich \\ncountries. \\n The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis \\nresolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, a new trade deal, climate \\nchange   they call for all our resources. Military \\nintervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes \\na solution cannot be found without armed force. \\nDevelopment budgets are necessary, but the developing \\nworld needs a growth plan, not just an aid plan. \\nDiplomacy needs to bridge differences between \\nnations, but also to reach out to civil society and \\nbusiness. \\n The United Kingdom is proud not just of its \\nbilateral relations with the countries represented in the \\nAssembly, but also of its commitment to multilateral \\ninstitutions, which can be a force for good in the world. \\nBut international institutions need to reflect the world \\nas it is, not the world as it was. The United Kingdom \\ntherefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental \\nnegotiations at this session to achieve agreement on \\nreform of the Security Council. We support permanent \\nmembership for Germany, Japan, India and Brazil and \\npermanent representation for Africa. We are not \\nwedded to a single model of reform. Achieving \\neffective change is what matters. \\n In a world where more than a billion people are \\nonline, where companies have bigger turnovers than \\ncountries and where global non-governmental \\norganizations have memberships that are bigger than \\nnational populations, our international institutions must \\nlook inwards to internal reform, but also outwards to \\nbroader popular movements for change. \\n In the last phase of globalization, in the \\nnineteenth century, the emergence of new Powers and \\nthe breakdown of the international order resulted in \\nconflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. \\nUnless we can build trust and reciprocity between \\nnations and embody them in durable and robust \\ninternational institutions that reconcile differences and \\nnurture common values, the latest phase of \\nglobalization could be another false dawn. \\n Globalization is not just something to which we \\nmust adapt; it is something that we can and must shape \\nfor the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to \\nuse spreading power, wealth and opportunity. For my \\nGovernment, this mission is driven by both moral \\npurpose and national interest. We must address the \\ninsecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders \\nif we are to enhance security and prosperity within our \\nborders. \\n We live in a more prosperous, more peaceful and \\nmore democratic world than ever before. Let us \\ncommit ourselves to living in a more equal world. \\n</td>\n",

To be sure, we had shown the right\\nconvictions in words, but shamefully, we had failed to\\nact. The lesson of that massacre — and of the even\\ngreater horror of Rwanda a year before — was that we\\nall needed better means to turn our collective will into\\ndecisive action. I think that we in the European Union\\nhave learned in the intervening period. Today, the\\nUnion is on the ground as a military, police or civilian\\npresence in Bosnia, in Aceh, in Iraq, in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo and, with the African Union, in\\nDarfur.\\nI also think that the United Nations has learned\\nthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit this\\nweek, we agreed on the further steps that we need to\\ntake for the Organization to be even more effective. Of\\nall that was agreed at the summit, I believe it will be\\nthe agreement on our “responsibility to protect” that\\nwill be seen in the future as having the greatest\\nsignificance of all. If we follow through on the\\nresponsibility to protect, then never again will\\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\\nhumanity be allowed to take place under our noses\\nwith nothing done.\\nThe responsibility to protect is, of course, a\\nreflection of our common morality. But it is also a\\nrecognition that the world in which we now live is too\\nsmall for us to be unaffected by, or indifferent to, the\\ninnocent victims of murder and oppression. This\\nshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it has\\nbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell, a generation\\nof ideological certainties was swept away. People could\\nsuddenly see partners where before they had only\\nglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrier\\nwas noisily being breached, a revolution in information\\ntechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distance\\nand time. Continents and cultures are now cabled\\ntogether and bound by trade and services in a way that\\nwas unimaginable even a decade ago.\\nIn this new world, we can no longer safely\\ntolerate the general threat that can come from a\\nparticular human tragedy, wherever it takes place. To a\\ngreater extent than ever before, we share the same\\nworld: the same threats and responsibilities, the same\\nopportunities and interests. And precisely because the\\nboundaries of our world have contracted, the\\nhorizons — the ambitions — of many people around\\nthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time in\\nour history, mankind has the ability to realize the\\npotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and in\\nevery region through an open exchange of goods,\\ninvestment, technology and, above all, ideas.\\nNot least in all of this, it is the rise of India and\\nof China that is reordering the world economy.\\nHundreds of millions there and elsewhere have been\\nlifted out of poverty. A new global market has been\\ncreated that ignores the divide — which seemed so\\nfundamental for so many decades — between East and\\nWest.\\nCurrently, not everyone has the chance to share in\\nall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remains\\nblighted by poverty, disease and conflict. The\\nEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable to\\nachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief, trade\\nreform and development aid are all vital, but none of\\nthem can work alone. Fundamental to making poverty\\nhistory are the Governments of the developing world\\nthemselves. And where Governments fail, their own\\npeoples are the victims, as United Nations Special\\nEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka’s damning assessment of the\\nsituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.\\nSub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet to\\nachieve its potential. The American author Thomas\\nFriedman, in his recent book The World Is Flat,\\nhighlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arab\\npeoples whose forebears devised algebra and the\\nalgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based,\\nbut those peoples are now right at the rear of today’s\\ntechnological revolution, with, for example, fewer than\\n2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.\\nThree United Nations Development Programme Arab\\nHuman Development Reports have now set out clearly\\nhow limited economic prospects and stunted political\\nfreedoms have led young and talented people towards\\nalienation and disillusionment.\\nThe answer, however, does not lie in easy\\nstereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is only\\nthe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us to\\nbelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally\\n28\\n\\ndifferent. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust and\\ndespair, and we reject it utterly. Indonesia and\\nTurkey — to name just two — are both striking\\nexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslim\\npopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.\\nWe in the European Union have seen the vibrant\\nMuslim communities in our own countries, and from\\nthat experience have seen how Islamic and Western\\ncultures can be partners in a global society.\\nEveryone knows that the Arab peoples want\\nprosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much\\nas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that the\\nArab world has the lowest scores in regional\\nmeasurements of democratic practices, civil freedoms\\nand good governance is not some cultural inevitability,\\nbut a temporary failure of human will. In that regard,\\nthe international community has a clear responsibility\\nto encourage regionally led political, social and\\neconomic reform. The European Union strongly\\nsupports such reform and will continue to do so.\\nEqually, it has been our active foreign policy that has\\nplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran, especially on\\nthe nuclear dossier.\\nWith our High Representative Javier Solana and\\nmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues,\\nwe have made detailed proposals for the relationship\\nbetween the European Union and Iran to be based on\\ncooperation and respect for international norms and\\ntreaties.\\nOur proposals envisage a high-level, long-term\\npolitical and security framework between the European\\nUnion and Iran, in which we would work together in\\npolitical, economic, scientific and technological areas,\\nincluding the civil nuclear field, in return for Iran\\nproviding guarantees about its intentions and\\ncapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So, we will\\nlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon’s\\nspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic of\\nIran, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\\nOn Iraq, the European Union now has a\\ncomprehensive programme of engagement and has put\\nbehind it divisions over the military action two and a\\nhalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of a\\npeaceful, prosperous, democratic and stable nation.\\nWe are also giving very active support to the\\nQuartet’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace\\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, with two States\\nliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon’s\\nbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and\\nwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas’s work to build\\nthe first stage of an effective, viable State of Palestine.\\nIn July, the European Union again suffered the\\nhorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the target\\nwas my country, the United Kingdom: its capital,\\nLondon. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.\\nInternational terrorism requires an international\\nresponse; otherwise, we all pay the price for each\\nother’s vulnerabilities. The ratification of a\\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism is, therefore, at the\\nhighest priority.\\nBut the threat from terrorists and the political\\ninstability they bring is made worse by the easy\\navailability of weapons in what has become an\\nanarchic, unregulated international trade. These same\\nweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia a\\ndecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.\\nWe already have international instruments to regulate\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We in the\\nEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms control\\nregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that the\\ntime has now come for this Organization to embrace\\nthe idea of an international arms trade treaty, which\\nwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.\\nIt was in the killing fields of Europe, in two\\nsuccessive wars, that the twin ideas of the United\\nNations and of the European Union became imperative.\\nToday, the European Union’s commitment to the\\nUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.\\nAnd it is reflected in what we give in voluntary\\ndonations and to the regular budget and peacekeeping\\noperations.\\nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations\\nremains today what it was at its foundation: to remove\\nthe scourge of war, to reaffirm the worth of the human\\nperson and to promote social progress and better\\nstandards of life. In this changed and changing world,\\nit is the responsibility of us all to ensure that this\\nOrganization has the powers and the resources to\\nachieve all these aims.   \n",

Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by those\\nwho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic,\\nprosperous future they so richly deserve. The best\\nservice that we can render her memory is to defeat the\\nterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful,\\nfree Iraq prevails.\\nOf course, we owe this service to all those who\\nhave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieira\\nde Mello and the United Nations personnel who were\\nkilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 August\\nwere committed to bringing the ideals of the United\\nNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimate\\nsacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss, but\\nwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqi\\npeople rebuild their country on the principles of justice\\nand security.\\nWhat, I think, makes Iraq so important was the\\nway in which it tested the role and purpose of this\\ninstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughout\\nthat period, the international community remained in\\nagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a\\nChapter VII threat to international peace and security\\nby its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will of\\nthe United Nations. Yet, earlier this year, sadly, we\\ndivided on when and what action was necessary to deal\\nwith the Iraqi threat.\\nOf course, I acknowledge the controversy over\\nthe military action which the United Kingdom, the\\nUnited States and others took and the heavy\\nresponsibilities we now bear, but I firmly believe that\\nthe decisions we took were the right ones. The\\nauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Having\\ngiven Saddam Hussein’s regime a final opportunity to\\ncomply with the United Nations, what would have\\nhappened if we had simply turned away? Would the\\nworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a better\\nplace today? Would the United Nations be a stronger\\ninstitution today? The answer to each of those\\nquestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have been\\nemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator would\\nhave been encouraged to follow his example; and the\\nauthority of this United Nations would have been\\ngravely weakened.\\nYet, whatever the arguments of the spring, we\\nhave now to come together again for a common\\npurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in its\\nthree resolutions 1472 (2003), 1483 (2003) and 1500\\n(2003), we have a shared interest in helping Iraqi\\ncitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which they\\nhave been denied so long and for which this institution\\nwas founded. Yes, the security situation does present\\nformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedom\\nare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They have\\ninflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people, coalition\\nsoldiers and international aid workers, but ultimately\\nthey will fail.\\nAnd let us also not lose sight of what has been\\nachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein’s\\nreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture and\\noppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of\\n31\\n \\nlives is at an end. Instead, we have the beginnings of a\\nrepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;\\nnew ministries providing daily services to the people; a\\nfree press; the freedom for members of all religious\\ncommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals and\\nschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets and\\nhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.\\nWe shall stay in Iraq as long, but only as long, as\\nit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and to\\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as we\\ncan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we can\\nagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthen\\nthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing this\\ntransition, we should be guided by three central\\nprinciples: first, the transfer of powers must reflect\\nrealities on the ground in Iraq, particularly the need to\\nensure security; secondly, the Iraqi institutions must be\\nsufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;\\nand thirdly, the exercise of executive powers and\\nresponsibilities must be based on good governance,\\ninvolving representative Iraqi authorities and coherent\\nconstitutional arrangements. In other words, the timetable\\nshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and their\\ncapacity progressively to assume democratic control,\\nrather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.\\nIraq is, sadly, not the only territory in the Middle\\nEast where the international community faces great\\nchallenges. Three months ago, we all had high hopes\\nabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations,\\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and the\\nUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It is\\ntragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 August\\nby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem, which came only\\na few hours after the terrorist atrocity against the\\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, but the international\\ncommunity has to stay united on both the means and\\nthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternatives\\nto the road map and there can be no alternatives to the\\noutcome the entire world wishes to see — two States,\\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and\\nsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to the\\nthousands who have died on both sides since the\\nbeginning of this appalling conflict.\\nThe breadth of the issues being tackled by the\\nUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates the\\ncontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-\\nTerrorism Committee has given the United Nations a\\nfocus for its work following  September two years\\nago, but we must now build upon that work, giving the\\nCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce the\\ncapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcome\\nterrorism.\\nWe also know that proliferation is one of the\\ngreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Much\\ngood work on proliferation is being done by United\\nNations agencies, particularly the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency, but it is extraordinary that the Security\\nCouncil itself has not addressed the issue of\\nproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement, it is\\ntime that it did.\\nProblems of internal conflict, on the other hand,\\nare regularly on the Security Council’s agenda. The\\nUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experience\\nin this area and has achieved great things in countries\\nas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone, but nation-\\nbuilding is a collaborative effort, requiring the\\nresources and commitment of Member States if the\\nUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. We\\ntherefore need new mechanisms to help prevent\\nconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.\\nWe must also make a real success of the\\nMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome the\\nsetback of Cancún and secure a positive outcome to the\\nDoha Round.\\nThese and other shared problems require\\ncollective responses, as our Secretary-General so\\neloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key to\\nthis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remains\\nan effective global forum capable of delivering results.\\nThe Secretary-General posed some difficult questions\\ntwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek the\\nadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals on\\nreform. I welcome, too, his parallel commitment to\\nmodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.\\nFor our part, the United Kingdom is committed to\\nmaking the Security Council more representative. The\\nissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger and\\nmore representative Council, however, will not of itself\\nmake it easier to make the tough choices which it has\\nto face so often. The most important ingredient is the\\npolitical will and determination of the members of the\\nCouncil to take effective action.\\nThe most important part of the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s speech on Tuesday was about the choices\\nnow confronting the United Nations. He was right\\nabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.\\n32\\n \\nDown one route lies a world in which the United\\nNations strengthens its role as the collective instrument\\nfor protecting our peace and security; down the other\\nroute lies a world in which collective action becomes a\\nsynonym for “inaction”. We must not take this second\\nroute. The Secretary-General’s speech was a challenge\\nto all of us. We all share a world in which international\\nterrorists strike down the innocent, regardless of faith\\nor nationality, and we are all less secure when weapons\\nof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do not\\nhave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism, while\\nproposing no multilateral means of confronting and\\ndealing with these threats.\\nThe British Government is profoundly\\ncommitted, as it always has been, to the ideals of the\\nUnited Nations. To us, the importance of this\\nOrganization has always been its ability to put those\\nhigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedly\\nwith the Secretary-General and the international\\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations retains\\nand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",
       "18  Mr. President, I\\noffer my congratulations and those of my country on\\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\\nits fifty-ninth session.\\nEighteen months ago, the United Nations faced\\ndivisions more serious than any since the Cuban\\nmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether\\nthe strength and unity which we had built up since the\\nend of the cold war could survive.\\nThen last year we watched, as Secretary-General\\nKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.\\nIn the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided\\nto follow our Secretary-Generalís directions. This\\nOrganization has not been plunged, as some predicted,\\ninto paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if\\nunspoken determination to make the United Nations\\nwork, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central\\ntask: to secure peace around the world.\\nOver the last 12 months we have dealt with new\\ncrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we\\nhave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government\\nand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great\\nLakes; mobilized international support for the new\\nIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important\\nsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they should\\nin the media ó Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste,\\nBougainville and Western Sahara.\\nWe have shown in those actions the unity of\\npurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our\\nhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.\\nAnd the search for consensus has not been confined to\\nthe Security Council.\\nI am proud that just a few months after the\\ndifficult times of early last year, France, Germany and\\nthe United Kingdom came together to work, as we\\ncontinue to do, on the Iran dossier before the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\\nI recognize, of course, the frustrations which all\\nof us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict,\\nwhere the clear path to peace set out in the road map\\nand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.\\nBut all in all we have shown the will to make collective\\naction work, though we know, too, that we need to go\\nfurther.\\nIn particular, we need to get better at tackling\\nthreats which have changed dramatically since the\\nfounding of the United Nations. Today the greatest\\nthreats to our security often come not from other\\nfunctioning sovereign States, but from terrorist\\norganizations, from failing States and from man-made\\nshocks to our environment like climate change, which\\ncan exacerbate State failure and breed internal\\ninstability.\\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General is\\npreparing its recommendations on ways to address the\\nvarious challenges. We should remember in all this that\\nwe have one great advantage. Though its institutions\\nand the founding text of the Charter has hardly\\nchanged in 60 years, the United Nations is not an\\norganization set in stone, but a set of living institutions\\nbased on a shared will to make collective security\\nwork. The United Nations has adapted in the past -\\nwith the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus\\non individual rights and the setting of global targets for\\n34\\n\\ndevelopment - and I am confident that it can adapt in\\nthe future.\\nOf course, institutional change is part of that. At\\nthe United Nations foundation, one eighth of its\\nmembers could expect to be elected members of the\\nSecurity Council at any one time. Today that\\nproportion is less than one eighteenth. The United\\nKingdom has long supported the case for expanding\\nthe Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for\\nincluding amongst the permanent members: Germany\\nand Japan, two countries which between them\\ncontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United\\nNations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire\\nworldís population; and Brazil, which just missed\\npermanent membership back in 1945.\\nBut we should not see an expansion of the\\nSecurity Council, or other institutional change, as a\\npanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common\\nunderstanding - the United Nations jurisprudence, if\\nyou like - and its operational effectiveness so that we\\ncan respond more quickly and more thoroughly to\\ntodayís new threats.\\nLet me highlight three areas which to me seem\\nparticularly important: first, our approach must be\\nbroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,\\nincluding poverty, disease and environmental\\ndegradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by\\nexpanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we\\nmust deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces\\nus all and everything for which we stand.\\nLet me now take these three points in turn. First,\\nthere is the need for a broader approach which\\naddresses the complex and interdependent nature of\\nsecurity today. Here, we have to do more to meet the\\nMillennium Development Goals and to promote\\nsustainable development, especially in Africa. We\\ncannot have security without development or\\ndevelopment without security.\\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his\\nspeech this week, we have to do more to entrench the\\nrule of law and justice, especially in States recovering\\nfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work\\non the Secretary-Generalís report during its Security\\nCouncil presidency next month.\\nWe could also use the United Nations better, to\\nagree to monitor and help implement globally accepted\\nnorms of good governance.\\nAnd we need to act together quickly on climate\\nchange, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our\\nworld in terms of stability and security. We have to\\nimplement Kyoto - and I greatly welcome what my\\ncolleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on\\nthat today - and agree to emission reductions beyond\\n2012.\\nMy second point is the need to build a new\\nconsensus on the scope of collective action. We all\\nrepresent independent, sovereign states. But even as we\\nfounded the United Nations we recognized that\\nsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nationís\\ngovernment: there to be respected, not abused, from\\neither without or within.\\nThe Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse\\nfrom without could be dealt with through the inherent\\nright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the\\nCharter. But it also said that an abuse from within\\nwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealt\\nwith by the Security Council, under the powers\\nenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the\\nCharter, and by the many conventions concluded\\nwithin the United Nations framework, including, for\\nexample, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer -\\nwe all said - could or should the world turn away\\nfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.\\nBut we have not always lived up to those high\\nexpectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia\\nten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to\\ndo so and to engage in situations of humanitarian\\ncatastrophe or grave violations of international\\nhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats\\nto international peace and security.\\nThe principle of non-interference has to be\\nqualified by a duty to protect, especially where\\nGovernments are failing in that duty.\\nWe therefore need, for example, to be ready to\\nsupport greater use by the Secretary-General of his\\npowers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats\\nto peace to the Security Council's attention. We have to\\nact quickly in response, because prevention is far better\\nthan cure. We should look to work more closely with\\nregional organizations, as we are doing with the\\nAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on\\nthe criteria as to when the international community\\nmight have to intervene with military force in extreme\\ncircumstances. We must get better at engaging for the\\nlong term in countries recovering from conflict,\\n35\\n\\ncoordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed\\npriorities.\\nMy third point is the urgent need to combat\\nglobal terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have\\nlearned anything in the three years since 11 September\\n2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate\\nin its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,\\nHindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion\\nor any religion, and of every or no shade of political\\nopinion, all have died through the terroristsí bullet or\\nbomb.\\nMy friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a\\nmoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible,\\nunspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that\\ntook place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears;\\nRussiaís tears are the worldís tears. We are all in the\\nfight against terrorism together.\\nToday in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to\\nwhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the\\nvictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts\\nand condolences are with the Government and people\\nof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims\\nof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping\\nIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.\\nOne of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held\\nhostage by terrorists who have already barbarically\\nmurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts\\nand prayers are with their families. We continue to do\\nall we can to secure Mr. Bigleyís release.\\nI know - how could I forget - that opinions\\nhave differed over the rightness of the military action\\ntaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no\\nnation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now\\noccurring there. For we all recognize that what is being\\nattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on\\nthe Iraqi people and on everything for which the\\nOrganization stands: safety, security and human rights.\\nWe have to come together to defeat the terrorists and\\ntheir despicable aims.\\nThe threat of terrorism confronts democratic,\\nproperly functioning States with an acute dilemma,\\nnamely, how to fight those who recognize none of the\\nvalues for which we stand while remaining true to\\nthose values. Our commitments under international\\nconventions express many of those values and the\\nimportance that we attach to them. But equally, those\\nconventions cannot be allowed to shelter those\\ninvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designed\\nto protect citizens from abuse by States, not by\\nterrorists.\\nThe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\\nRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear of\\npersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so\\nmany other nations have offered that protection when and\\nwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Convention\\nitself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does\\nnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a\\ncrime against humanity or other serious crime; nor\\ndoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary\\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\\nWe must never stoop to the level of the terrorist ó\\nto torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration ó\\nnor will any country within the European Union be\\nparty to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor\\nto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists\\nexploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not\\nthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall\\ntherefore be working closely with Russia on its\\nimportant draft Security Council resolution, to see how\\nbest we can prevent those who commit, support and\\nfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee\\nstatus to which they are not entitled. Along with the\\nRussian Federation and other partners in the Security\\nCouncil, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the\\nspeedier extradition of such individuals.\\nWe, the United Nations, have over the last year\\nbegun to show a new determination to come together\\nand to make collective action work. A year from now,\\nwe will meet again here to review the\\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\\nChallenges and Change, as well as the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals, and to set the United Nations\\nagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdomís\\nchairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on\\ntackling climate change and on Africa, on which the\\nIndependent Commission for Africa will be producing\\nrecommendations as to how best we can support the\\nradical agenda for change and development designed\\nby Africa itself through the New Partnership for\\nAfricaís Development and the African Union. Our\\npresidency of the European Union will help us to lead\\nefforts for a successful outcome in the Doha\\nDevelopment Round, and for building the European\\nUnionís crisis-management capabilities.\\nMore than ever, global security is our shared\\nresponsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to\\n36\\n\\nadapt to todayís threats and challenges, we must find\\nrenewed determination and political will to make\\ncollective security work. The United Kingdom is\\ndetermined to play its full part in that endeavour.   \n",

Kofi Annan has been more of \\neverything: more of a diplomat, more of a reformer and \\nmore of a moral voice of leadership in the world. \\n In a world shattered by conflict, the founders of \\nthe United Nations saw that only by coming together, \\nunited in support of larger freedom, could we build our \\nshared future. Today, when the world’s nations are \\neven more interdependent than they were in 1945, what \\ndoes it mean to stand, as they intended, united? At one \\nlevel it means taking action when things go wrong, \\nwhere there is an actual breakdown of security or a \\ndescent into violence or chaos. Today in particular, the \\nUnited Nations faces the challenges posed by multiple \\nupheavals and crises across the world. \\n In the Middle East the United Nations is playing \\na vital role in establishing stability in southern \\nLebanon. Troops from the European Union are \\ndeploying alongside those from the Middle East, Asia \\nand Africa. All Member States must meet their \\nobligations under Security Council resolutions 1701 \\n(2006), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), if we are to \\nenable Lebanon to be the proud, democratic and \\ndiverse nation that its people want it to be. \\n But we are all aware that this most recent conflict \\nin Lebanon had its roots in the continuing failure to \\nachieve a just solution to the Palestinian question. That \\nis why the United Kingdom has consistently argued \\nthat there can be no higher priority than reinvigorating \\nthe Middle East peace process. \\n In Iraq, Prime Minister Al-Maliki’s national \\nreconciliation plan can help leaders from all \\ncommunities come together. At this crucial juncture, \\nwe must all intensify our support. The International \\nCompact provides the right vehicle. It allows the Iraqi \\nGovernment to set its own vision and shows us how we \\ncan help turn that vision into a reality. \\n In Afghanistan, real progress has been made, with \\nthe United Nations taking a leading role in \\ncoordinating the international effort. But real \\nchallenges still lie ahead. NATO’s task of securing the \\nsouth of the country is far from easy. Soldiers from \\nmany NATO countries, not least my own, have given \\ntheir lives to provide a better future for the people of \\nAfghanistan. The Afghan Government and people, too, \\nwant security, development and good governance. The \\nUnited Kingdom and the international community are \\ndetermined to help them to achieve them. \\n We must show a similar shared determination in \\nurging the Government of Iran to address international \\nconcerns over its nuclear ambitions and its support for \\nterrorism. The proposals put forward by Britain, France \\nand Germany with China, Russia and the United States \\noffer a path for the Iranian Government to develop a \\nmore constructive relationship with the rest of the \\nworld and give Iran’s talented population the \\nopportunities and prosperity that is their right, \\nincluding, if they wish, a modern nuclear power \\nindustry. We want to be able to resume negotiations. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 20 \\n \\nIran knows what is required, and that the alternative is \\nincreasing isolation. \\n Darfur remains in crisis. I pay tribute to the \\nefforts of the African Union and its peacekeepers. \\nWednesday’s decision to extend their mandate averted \\na security vacuum. We must now strengthen the force \\nof the African Union Mission in the Sudan. But it can \\nonly be a temporary reprieve. We also need action \\nimmediately on the political and humanitarian front. \\nThose who have not signed the Darfur Peace \\nAgreement must do so. Those who have must abide by \\nits provisions. \\n To underpin that Agreement, we urgently need a \\ngreatly strengthened international presence on the \\nground, with the active engagement and support of \\nAsian and Muslim, as well as African, countries. That \\nis why the Security Council authorized the deployment \\nof United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur. I urge \\nPresident Bashir to extend the Sudan’s relations with \\nthe United Nations in a common purpose to bring \\nlasting peace and genuine stability to the whole of the \\nSudan. It is, above all, his responsibility. \\n The security challenges the world faces are real. \\nAs an international community we must deal with \\nthem. But standing united also requires us to take up a \\nsecond, deeper level of global responsibility, namely, \\ntackling the underlying problems that promote conflict \\nand underdevelopment. We must strive to promote \\nsound global values and to build multilateral systems \\nwithin which nations and individuals can cooperate, \\nco-exist and each achieve their potential. \\n Many representatives to the Assembly have \\nalready spoken of the need to accelerate progress \\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Progress on those Goals is a moral \\nimperative rooted in a concern for, and an \\nunderstanding of, our common humanity. But it is also \\na political imperative, because there will be no stability \\nand security in our global community while so many \\nmillions of men, women and children in that \\ncommunity face only a life of hunger, poverty, \\ninequality and disease. \\n The same is true for those whose lives are \\nshattered by conflict or blighted by injustice. The \\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \\nCouncil are new structures that give us new \\nopportunities and new impetus. At the same time, we \\nmust see a step change in efforts towards an \\ninternational arms trade treaty that will end the \\nirresponsible transfer of arms that fuel conflict and \\nfacilitate the abuse of human rights. That is why the \\nUnited Kingdom, with six other countries, will \\nintroduce a draft resolution in the First Committee to \\nestablish a process to work towards a legally binding \\ntreaty on the trade in all conventional arms. \\n Collectively, we have a responsibility to protect \\nhuman life and a duty to defend the international \\ninstitutions that help us as a community to achieve that \\ngoal. The answers lie not in division or in personal \\nattacks, but in the earnest and consistent pursuit of \\njustice and peace.  \\n Our collective responsibility to each other is \\nnowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed \\nby climate change. The British Prime Minister, Tony \\nBlair, made climate change one of our two G8 \\npriorities last year, alongside poverty reduction in \\nAfrica. When the Prime Minister appointed me as his \\nForeign Secretary, in May, he specifically charged me \\nwith putting climate security at the heart of our foreign \\npolicy. We will not solve that problem if we do not \\neach assume our share of the responsibility for tackling \\nit. Nobody can protect themselves from climate change \\nunless we protect each other by building a global basis \\nfor climate security. That goes to the heart of the \\nUnited Nations mission, and the United Nations must \\nbe at the heart of the solution. \\n To put it starkly, if we all try to freeride, we will \\nall end up in free fall, with accelerating climate change \\nthe result of our collective failure to respond in time to \\nthat shared threat that faces us all. Look just at the \\ndanger posed by rising sea levels. Potentially, that \\ncould cause massive damage to some of the key urban \\ncentres of our global civilization. London, Shanghai, \\nDhaka, Singapore, Amsterdam, Cairo and, yes, \\nManhattan are all at risk. That is why we must all — as \\nforeign ministers, heads of Government and heads of \\nState — be ready to do more, and do it more quickly. \\nOur climate presents us with an ever-growing threat to \\ninternational security. Dealing with climate change, by \\nboth adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to \\navert still greater damage, is no longer a choice, it is an \\nimperative. \\n We need common commitment and genuine \\naction. We must all be ready to find a way to get the \\nagenda moving beyond Kyoto. The Gleneagles \\ndialogue meeting in Mexico at the beginning of \\n \\n \\n21 06-53317 \\n \\nOctober will be one such opportunity, a chance for \\ndeveloped and developing countries to work together \\non that shared problem.  \\n If we do not act now, an unstable climate will \\nundermine our progress in all those other areas that \\nmatter to us, not least the Millennium Development \\nGoals themselves. Take one of the most basic needs of \\nall, water. Already perhaps two fifths of the world’s \\npopulation finds it hard to get the water they need. At \\nthe same time, many in the world rely on affordable \\nenergy to help lift themselves out of poverty — and, \\nindeed, perhaps to give them access to that water. But \\nthere is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by \\nburning fossil fuels, we accelerate climate change. That \\nmeans further disrupting water supplies. For some \\npeople who now have plenty of water it will mean new \\nshortages. For those who already have little, it will \\nmean less. In turn, everywhere less water means less \\nfood. \\n Let me give a specific example of that dilemma. \\nThe whole world, as well as the Chinese people, is \\nbenefiting from the great success of the Chinese \\neconomy. No one in China or elsewhere wants that \\ngrowth to stop. But it is based, in China as elsewhere, \\non a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are \\ncreating climate change. Yet China is a country already \\nvulnerable to climate change. The Chinese Government \\nknows that as the Himalayan glaciers melt and \\nagricultural land shrinks, crop yields will fall, fresh \\nwater will become more scarce and the economy itself \\nwill suffer, and with it the world’s economy. \\n All the nations of the Arctic Circle are being, and \\nwill be, affected by melting permafrost, with \\ndisruptions to infrastructure and to investment. The \\nVice-President of Palau has just given us a vivid \\ndescription of what the environment means for his \\nnation. We all share, to a greater or lesser extent, that \\nsame dilemma. If we do not act on climate change, we \\nrisk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and \\nsecurity we are seeking to achieve. That is why we \\nmust recognize that talk of having either a successful \\neconomy or a stable climate is a false choice. We must \\nwork together to find paths for economic growth that \\nwill protect our climate. The truth is that we already \\nhave much of the technology we need to move to a \\nlow-carbon economy. But we must now deploy it very \\nmuch more rapidly. What we do in the next 10 years \\nwill count the most.  \\n The former chief economist of the World Bank, \\nSir Nicholas Stern, will shortly publish one of the most \\nsignificant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the \\neconomic impacts of climate change itself. One of the \\nkey emerging findings of his work is that while it will \\nnot cost the Earth to solve climate change, it will cost \\nthe Earth, literally as well as financially, if we do not. \\n Moreover, if we learn to tackle climate change \\ntogether, we have an opportunity to build trust between \\nnations and to strengthen the multilateral system. But if \\nwe get it wrong, that trust will be further eroded. It is \\nthe developed, rich world that bears a large \\nresponsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas \\nemissions, but it is the poorest in our global \\ncommunity — those least able to bear it — who will \\nbear the brunt of climate insecurity. We all need to do \\nmore. But the rich world should of course continue to \\nlead the effort, applying the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibility, which must continue to be \\nour guide. In the joint endeavour which the United \\nNations represents there can be no more stark or more \\nurgent warning than that.    \n",
       "32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It is a great  honour to make my first speech to the General \\nAssembly. \\n The United Nations has a duty to lead the world \\nin addressing the shared threats and opportunities that \\ndominate our age, and it must do so in deed as well as \\nin word. That is why I want to use this platform to \\nexpress my admiration and support for United Nations \\nmissions around the world, from Lebanon to Liberia, \\nfrom Congo and Haiti to East Timor, which, even as we \\nmeet in New York this week, are saving lives and \\nspreading hope. \\n Since 1946, when the first meeting of the General \\nAssembly took place in London, the United Kingdom \\nhas been determined to fulfil its international \\nresponsibilities through the United Nations. The new \\nGovernment in the United Kingdom, under the \\nleadership of Gordon Brown, is proud to continue that \\ntradition, and I reaffirm our commitment today. \\n The focus at this session has been on immediate \\nand pressing issues. In the Middle East, we need urgent \\naction towards a two-State solution that addresses the \\nsecurity of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the \\nsame time.  \\n In Iraq, recent security gains can only be \\nsustained through continued support for the \\ndevelopment of the Iraqi security forces, through \\nnational reconciliation and through political support \\nfrom the whole region. \\n Our international community depends on \\nresponsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a \\nleading and respected country, it must cease its support \\nfor terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its \\ndefiance of three Security Council resolutions in \\nrespect of its nuclear programme. \\n In Zimbabwe, we need United Nations action to \\nsupport African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle \\nof economic and social devastation that now afflicts \\nthe country. \\n We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in \\nBurma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest, \\nencourage national dialogue and promote genuine \\nreconciliation. Let us today send a message to the \\nmonks on the streets of Burma: we support your \\ndemand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a \\nmessage from the monks on the streets of Burma: the \\nhuman desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or \\nreligion or region. It is good that the Burmese \\nGovernment has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the \\ncountry, but it is now vital that they use his presence \\nthere to start the process of reconciliation. \\n But as well as addressing the traumas of our \\nfellow citizens around the world, the United Nations \\nmust be the place where we address the longer-term \\nthreats. Today, I devote my speech to one of the great \\nthreats to stability and prosperity in the world: the \\nthreat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities \\nare not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. \\nInequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for \\nan open, global economy. It corrodes trust and respect \\nand reciprocity between nations. \\n The United Nations Charter talks of the \\n“sovereign equality of States”, and it also talks of the \\n“equal rights and dignity of men and women and of \\nnations large and small”. The principle of equality is \\nnowhere more evident than in the General Assembly \\nwhere all States have an equal voice. But in the world \\noutside this Hall, economic, social and political \\ninequalities within and between States persist and \\nworsen. We cannot stand united against the shared \\nthreats and opportunities in our world when we are so \\ndivided by economic and political disparities. So the \\nneed for Governments and international institutions to \\nreduce inequalities and promote our common humanity \\nis stark. \\n Traditionally, we have focused on the divide \\nbetween developed and developing nations. However, \\nthe growth rates in many developing countries are \\nfaster than in developed economies. That is the good \\nnews. But there remain around a billion people in the \\nworld   one sixth of its population   living in 58 \\ncountries, who have been left out of the story of human \\nprogress. This “bottom billion” have an average life \\nexpectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the \\nchildren in the bottom billion die before their fifth \\nbirthday, and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The \\ncountries that are home to the bottom billion saw their \\nnational incomes fall each year during the 1980s and \\n1990s. \\n Even where inequalities are narrowing between \\nnations, they are widening within them. According to \\nthe United Nations Development Programme, in 73 \\ncountries   containing 80 per cent of the world’s \\npopulation   economic inequality has risen in recent \\nyears. \\n Every nation represented here has responsibilities \\nto its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs \\nopen markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens \\nthrough democratic and transparent institutions, free \\nfrom corruption. It needs strong and effective \\neducation and health services open to all. \\n But national action is not enough. Because the \\ncauses of inequality cross national boundaries, we need \\ncooperation between nations, bilateral and multilateral, \\nled by the United Nations. \\n First, three quarters of the countries where the \\nbottom billion citizens reside have recent or current \\nexperience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to \\nextreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200,000 \\npeople are dead, 2 million are displaced and 4 million \\nare on food aid. As the international community, we \\ndecided on a course of action in Security Council \\nresolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: \\nan agreement on force composition, swift deployment, \\neffective protection of civilians on the ground and a \\npolitical process in which the legitimate grievance of \\nthe Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In \\nAfghanistan, one of the five poorest countries in the \\nworld, we need to back up military efforts to secure \\nsafe space with economic, social and political \\nreconstruction. \\n Beyond those crises, we also need to improve our \\ncapacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is \\nour vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical \\ndimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose \\neasy availability makes it so simple to set up militias \\nand provoke violence and mayhem. Last year, the \\nAssembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward \\nUnited Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see \\nresolution 61/89). The Government of the United \\nKingdom will continue to press for the achievement of \\nthat goal. \\n Secondly, freedom from conflict is the platform \\nfor progress, but the battle against disease and \\nilliteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some \\ncountries, the world is off track to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That is why, in July here \\nat the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the United \\nKingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own \\ncommitments and go further, to build a truly global \\npartnership   with the private sector, trade unions, \\nfaith groups, civil society and cities   that can meet \\nthe 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed \\nworld to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of \\nits national incomes on development. The United \\nKingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that \\nrequires shared responsibility. Poor governance and \\ncorruption are the enemies of development. \\n Thirdly, progress on aid needs to be combined \\nwith a new global trade deal that opens up economies \\non a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit \\nfrom subsidies and tariffs, particularly for agriculture. \\nHigher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor \\ncountries from diversifying their economies. That is a \\nbad deal for Western consumers, and it squeezes out \\nthe livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither \\nis it in rich countries’ financial self-interest, nor is it \\nfair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes \\nthat concluding the Doha trade round this year is not \\njust necessary, but also possible, and we will work to \\nachieve that goal. \\n Finally, we must address the greatest long-term \\nthreat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate \\nchange. Climate change affects all countries, but the \\npoorest countries   and the poorest people within \\nthose countries   will suffer the most disruption and \\ndevastation. I congratulate the President of the General \\nAssembly on choosing climate change as a central \\ntheme of this general debate. And I congratulate the \\nSecretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But \\nwe need more than debate. \\n The United Nations Framework Convention on \\nClimate Change is the only body that can conclude a \\nglobal agreement on climate change. Therefore, in the \\nnext two months we need an urgent agreement on the \\nsteps towards progress to be taken at the December \\nmeeting in Bali. Beyond that, we need a road map to \\nthe 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be \\nheld at Copenhagen in two years’ time, and agreement \\non a global deal that succeeds the end of the first \\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \\n At the heart of such an agreement must be the \\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities: \\nall countries taking on responsibilities, but making sure \\nthat they are equitably distributed, with the greatest \\naction taken by the richest countries. The United \\nKingdom stands ready to play its part. This year, our \\nclimate change bill will be enacted into law in the next \\nsession of Parliament to place on a statutory footing \\nour commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 \\nper cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we \\nneed similar binding commitments from all rich \\ncountries. \\n The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis \\nresolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, a new trade deal, climate \\nchange   they call for all our resources. Military \\nintervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes \\na solution cannot be found without armed force. \\nDevelopment budgets are necessary, but the developing \\nworld needs a growth plan, not just an aid plan. \\nDiplomacy needs to bridge differences between \\nnations, but also to reach out to civil society and \\nbusiness. \\n The United Kingdom is proud not just of its \\nbilateral relations with the countries represented in the \\nAssembly, but also of its commitment to multilateral \\ninstitutions, which can be a force for good in the world. \\nBut international institutions need to reflect the world \\nas it is, not the world as it was. The United Kingdom \\ntherefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental \\nnegotiations at this session to achieve agreement on \\nreform of the Security Council. We support permanent \\nmembership for Germany, Japan, India and Brazil and \\npermanent representation for Africa. We are not \\nwedded to a single model of reform. Achieving \\neffective change is what matters. \\n In a world where more than a billion people are \\nonline, where companies have bigger turnovers than \\ncountries and where global non-governmental \\norganizations have memberships that are bigger than \\nnational populations, our international institutions must \\nlook inwards to internal reform, but also outwards to \\nbroader popular movements for change. \\n In the last phase of globalization, in the \\nnineteenth century, the emergence of new Powers and \\nthe breakdown of the international order resulted in \\nconflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. \\nUnless we can build trust and reciprocity between \\nnations and embody them in durable and robust \\ninternational institutions that reconcile differences and \\nnurture common values, the latest phase of \\nglobalization could be another false dawn. \\n Globalization is not just something to which we \\nmust adapt; it is something that we can and must shape \\nfor the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to \\nuse spreading power, wealth and opportunity. For my \\nGovernment, this mission is driven by both moral \\npurpose and national interest. We must address the \\ninsecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders \\nif we are to enhance security and prosperity within our \\nborders. \\n We live in a more prosperous, more peaceful and \\nmore democratic world than ever before. Let us \\ncommit ourselves to living in a more equal world. \\n   \n",

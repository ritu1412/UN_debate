I am confident that under your\\nguidance this session will achieve fruitful results. I also\\nwish to take this opportunity to express my sincere\\nrespects to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the previous\\nsession, and to the Secretary-General.\\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\\nend of the world war against fascism and the founding\\nof the United Nations. Just a few days ago in this Hall,\\nworld leaders solemnly adopted the outcome document\\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1).\\nNow, it falls to us to fulfil the important and pressing\\ntask of working towards a harmonious world of lasting\\npeace and common prosperity by translating that\\ndocument into action and turning fine words into\\nreality. This session should serve to promote peace,\\nharmony and common development.\\nWe want peaceful development. Progress of\\nmankind needs a peaceful environment. Stability and\\nsecurity of one country cannot be built on the\\nturbulence or crisis of another. Only a new security\\nconcept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality\\nand coordination will enable us to develop in peace and\\nsafeguard peace through development.\\nWe want harmonious development. To build a\\nbetter future is the long-cherished dream of mankind.\\nAny development strategy should be guided by a long-\\nterm and holistic perspective instead of immediate and\\nsectoral benefits. Therefore, we should work together\\nfor more democratic and law-based international\\nrelations and a harmonious environment in which\\ncountries respect one another, treat one another as\\nequals, and in which different cultures can emulate and\\ninterchange with each other.\\n18\\n\\nWe want common development. No model of\\ndevelopment that benefits only a few countries or a\\nsmall group of people is acceptable or sustainable.\\nCountries should cooperate with each other more\\nclosely so that economic globalization may yield\\nsuccessful results, benefit-sharing and common\\nprosperity.\\nThis session should serve to push forward\\nreforms of the United Nations and strengthen its role.\\nHaving weathered 60 years of vicissitudes, the United\\nNations needs multifaceted and multidimensional\\nreforms so as to be able to make a greater contribution\\nto mankind’s noble cause of peace and development.\\nThe position of the United Nations as the core of\\nthe world collective security mechanism must be\\nstrengthened so that it can perform its duty of\\nsafeguarding peace in a more effective way. China\\nsupports the efforts to enhance the Organization’s\\ncapacity on conflict prevention, mediation and good\\noffices. We also favour a greater role by the Secretary-\\nGeneral in this respect and the fostering of a preventive\\nculture.\\nWe support the efforts to strengthen United\\nNations peacekeeping operations, particularly with\\nregard to rapid deployment capacity and strategic\\npreparedness, as well as the capacity to fully mobilize\\nregional organizations and their resources under the\\nleadership of the Security Council.\\nChina supports the establishment of a\\nPeacebuilding Commission to more effectively\\ncoordinate United Nations efforts in the areas of\\npeacekeeping, post-conflict rehabilitation and\\ndevelopment. In that respect, the Economic and Social\\nCouncil and other development assistance agencies\\nshould have an important role to play in the\\nCommission.\\nIt has been our consistent position to oppose the\\nuse or threat of force in international relations. We do\\nnot support the reinterpretation or revision of the\\nprovisions in the Charter of the United Nations related\\nto the right of self-defence. Should an occasion arise\\nthat calls for the use of force, it is the Security Council\\nthat should make sound judgements and take prudent\\ndecisions as to the merits of the situation.\\nThe international community should continue to\\npress ahead with the international process on arms\\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation; safeguard\\nand enhance the authority and effectiveness of existing\\nmultilateral treaties; give full scope to the role of the\\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\\nthe area of non-proliferation; and seek solutions to\\nrelated issues by political and diplomatic means.\\nThe United Nations should be able to cope more\\neffectively with non-traditional security threats. We\\nwelcome the comprehensive strategy on counter-\\nterrorism proposed by the Secretary-General, and we\\nhope to see the early conclusion of a comprehensive\\nconvention on international terrorism, taking full\\naccount of the concerns of various parties, particularly\\ndeveloping countries.\\nIn the effort to reduce and prevent large-scale\\nhumanitarian crises, the international community\\nshould strictly observe the United Nations Charter,\\nrespect the opinions of the countries or organizations\\nconcerned and, with the Security Council’s\\nauthorization, explore, to the greatest extent possible,\\npeaceful settlement within the United Nations\\nframework. We oppose any rash intervention carried\\nout on the basis of the claim that a nation is unable or\\nunwilling to protect its own citizens.\\nDevelopment should be a main focus of United\\nNations reform. Although China is a low-income\\ndeveloping country, it is prepared to contribute as\\nmuch as it can to international cooperation for\\ndevelopment. As President Hu Jintao announced at the\\nsummit, China will take substantive steps in five areas.\\nWe will join hands with all Members to advance\\nreforms in the area of development so as to facilitate\\nthe resolution of development issues. The United\\nNations should put in place a fair and rational\\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) review\\nframework to assess progress made in various\\ncountries and to monitor follow-up of international\\ncooperation and aid commitments. We support the\\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council\\nin development-related areas.\\nThe Doha Round should embody development in\\nits focus, paying more attention and taking actions to\\naddress the concerns of developing countries,\\nparticularly with regard to agricultural produce and\\nspecial and differential treatment. China has decided to\\ngrant zero-tariff treatment to some commodities from\\n39 least developed countries, which will cover the\\nmajority of China’s imports from those countries.\\n19\\n\\nChina is in favour of incorporating the prevention\\nand treatment of HIV/AIDS and the building of the\\npublic health sector into the development programmes\\nand activities of various countries and of the United\\nNations. We will be submitting at the current session a\\ndraft resolution on strengthening global capacity-\\nbuilding in the area of public health. In the next three\\nyears, we plan to provide more aid and medicine to\\ndeveloping countries for preventing and treating\\nmalaria and other communicable diseases and to help\\nthem establish and reform their public health systems\\nand train medical personnel.\\nThe international community — particularly\\ndeveloped countries — should take substantive steps to\\nhelp developing countries break the vicious circle of\\ndebt. Such steps include substantial debt reduction and\\nthe streamlining of debt relief procedures and\\nrequirements. In the next two years, China will write\\noff or otherwise cancel the overdue portions, as of the\\nend of 2004, of interest-free or low-interest\\nGovernment loans owed by all heavily indebted poor\\ncountries having diplomatic relations with China.\\nWe call on the United Nations to give priority to\\nhelping developing countries to strengthen their\\ncapacity-building. China will help developing\\ncountries train 30,000 people for various professions in\\nthe next three years.\\nMy country also favours setting a timetable for\\ndeveloped countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their\\ngross national income to official development\\nassistance. New fund-raising methods should be\\nexplored so as to put more funds into development.\\nChina pledges $10 billion in concessional loans\\nto developing countries in the next three years within\\nthe framework of South-South cooperation.\\nThe Charter of the United Nations grants the\\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the\\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A\\nhighly efficient, responsible and representative Council\\nserves the long-term interests of the United Nations\\nand the common interests of all its Member States.\\nChina supports reform of the Security Council\\naimed at strengthening its authority and efficiency and\\nimproving its working methods. The representation of\\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\\nshould be increased so that small and medium-sized\\ncountries would have more say in the Council’s\\ndecision-making. No reform proposal can work that\\naddresses only the concerns of a few countries,\\ndisregarding the interests of the majority of countries,\\nand treats developing countries in Africa and in other\\nparts of the world unfairly.\\nChina supports the principle of cooperation based\\non democratic consultation. As reform will affect the\\nfuture of the United Nations and the interests of\\nvarious parties, there should be no artificial timeframes\\nor attempts to force decisions through a vote. Instead,\\nMember States should seek consensus through dialogue\\nand consultation and in accordance with the principle\\nof democratic international relations.\\nChina embraces the spirit of unity and\\ncooperation. The United Nations family has 191\\nMembers. Unity is the source of strength. We want\\nunity, not division. As long as Member States respect\\none another’s interests, accommodate one another’s\\nconcerns and show pragmatism and flexibility, we will\\nbe able to find a reform path that is acceptable to all.\\nThe current session should focus on Africa.\\nAfrican countries make up a quarter of the United\\nNations membership, and their populations account for\\n13 per cent of the world’s total population. If there is\\nno stability in Africa, the world will have no peace. If\\nAfrica remains poor, there will be no development for\\nthe world. The outcome document of the summit calls\\nfor efforts to meet the special needs of Africa. I believe\\nthat that is correct and necessary.\\nDespite the gratifying progress made in Africa in\\nrecent years, conflicts in some of its regions have\\npersisted. The Security Council should pay special\\nattention to African problems and give them priority on\\nits agenda. That means not only devoting more Council\\nmeetings to African issues, but also, and more\\nimportant, taking concrete actions to heed Africa’s\\nvoice, respect its views and accommodate its concerns.\\nChina applauds the mediation and good offices of\\nthe African Union and other regional organizations\\naimed at conflict settlement in Africa. We support\\nclose cooperation between the Security Council and\\nthose organizations by providing them with funds,\\nlogistics and technical assistance to strengthen their\\npeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction\\ncapacities.\\nAfrican countries face difficulties in the area of\\ndevelopment, particularly in attaining the MDGs. More\\n20\\n\\nthan 300 million people are still living under the\\npoverty line. One third of all children are\\nmalnourished. More than 30 million people are\\nsuffering from HIV/AIDS. With less than 2 per cent of\\nthe world’s economic aggregate, Africa is weighed\\ndown by debts amounting to $300 billion. All of that\\nposes a challenge to the conscience of mankind.\\nThe international community should reach a\\nglobal consensus on African development and help the\\ncontinent to achieve the MDGs on schedule by\\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s\\nDevelopment. Those who provide assistance must do\\nso in all sincerity and respect the right of African\\ncountries to make their own decisions. Assistance must\\nalso have a clear aim: to meet the basic and long-term\\nneeds of the African people. Assistance is by no means\\ncharity or a gift; it is a response to the call for mutual\\nbenefit and common development. Furthermore, it is\\nour moral duty to help the needy and redress injustices.\\nIn the twentieth century, Africa shook off\\ncolonial rule and achieved national liberation. That was\\nan epoch-making event. The twenty-first century will\\nbring peace and development to Africa — it is\\nhistorically inevitable. The Chinese people will\\ncontinue to stand beside their African brothers and\\nsisters on that journey of historic significance.\\nThe recently concluded Six-Party Talks in Beijing\\non the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have reached an\\nimportant consensus and issued a joint declaration,\\nmarking an important step forward in the Talks and a\\ncrystallization of the political will and diligence of the\\nparties concerned. It also reflects the common\\naspiration of the international community. Because it\\nwas so hard-won, this result needs to be especially\\nprized. We hope that the parties will continue to work\\ntogether to promote further progress in the Six-Party\\nTalks, resolve the nuclear issue on the Peninsula\\nthrough dialogue and by peaceful means, ensure lasting\\npeace and stability in the region and realize its\\ncommon goals for development and prosperity. The\\nChinese Government will continue to make a positive\\ncontribution in that regard.</td>\n",

       "      <td>﻿Please allow me warmly to congratulate Mr. Hunte, on\\nhis assumption of the presidency of the General\\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I would also like\\nto thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his valuable contribution as\\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\\nI also take this opportunity to express my\\nheartfelt condolences on the recent tragic deaths in\\nBaghdad of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\\nother United Nations staff members.\\nThe twenty-first century is about to complete its\\nthird year, with hope and distress coexisting side by\\n28\\n\\nside. Peace and development remain the overriding\\nthemes of the times and the shared aspirations of\\npeople of all races, colours and nationalities. The\\nconcept of democracy and equality has planted deep\\nroots in the hearts of the people. The shared\\nconfrontation of global challenges through stronger\\ncoordination and cooperation has become the\\nconsensus of the international community.\\nCountries are increasingly closer in their\\neconomic relations. Advanced means of\\ncommunications have made it possible to share\\ninformation in real time. With their interests closely\\nconnected and intertwined, countries are finding\\nthemselves more and more like passengers in the same\\nboat. Regional cooperation has grown substantially in\\nboth depth and scope, with cooperation mechanisms\\ntaking shape at various levels. Regional economic\\nintegration is forging ahead in many parts of the world.\\nThere are, however, many worrisome aspects of\\nthe international situation. Local wars and conflicts\\ncontinue to emerge sporadically. Although the Iraq war\\nis over, peace remains elusive, with no end of suffering\\nin sight for the Iraqi people. With the situation between\\nIsrael and Palestine still experiencing ups and downs,\\nthe Middle East peace process remains a long, uphill\\njourney. In Africa, wars are still raging in some\\ncountries.\\nNon-traditional security concerns such as\\nterrorism, drug-trafficking, arms proliferation, the\\nspread of diseases and environmental degradation have\\nbecome more pronounced. Given modern conditions,\\nthey can easily spread within regions or even across the\\nworld, making the security situation of human\\ncommunities even more complicated.\\nHumankind still confronts severe challenges in its\\ndevelopment. In the past 30 years, the number of least\\ndeveloped countries has doubled, reaching 50, which\\naccounts for one quarter of the United Nations\\nmembership. The ever-widening gap between the North\\nand South and the aggravated disparity between the\\nrich and the poor have become a major factor breeding\\nnew conflicts and wars and undermining regional\\nstability.\\nAt a moment like this, people are inevitably\\npondering the same question: in the interest of world\\npeace and common development, what kind of new\\nworld order should we establish in the twenty-first\\ncentury?\\nChina is of the view that the future well-being of\\nhumankind hinges on closer international cooperation\\nand a multipolar world. We should promote democracy\\nin international relations. Multipolarization does not\\nmean back-pedalling into the age of spheres of\\ninfluence or a replay of the now long-gone rivalry of\\nmajor Powers. It simply means bringing about a new\\nregime of international relations under which all\\ncountries — big or small, rich or poor, strong or\\nweak — are treated as equals, and under which no\\ncountry has the right to impose its will on others.\\nWe should cultivate a new security concept based\\non the principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit,\\nequality and cooperation. Security should be\\nmaintained through cooperation, and disputes should\\nbe resolved peacefully through dialogue. The frequent\\nuse of force and the threat of its use should be avoided.\\nThe practice of building one’s own security at the\\nexpense of others should be rejected.\\nWe should support diversity in the process of\\ndevelopment. Our world is a place of many colours and\\nstyles. A single musical note cannot make a melody,\\nnor does a phonetic alphabet make a language. Human\\nwisdom has produced so many civilizations, allowing\\nus to follow different paths of development and a\\nvariety of values. It is through the exchanges,\\nemulations and integrations of diverse cultures that\\nhuman reason and wisdom shine brilliantly.\\nWe should dedicate ourselves to the\\nempowerment of developing countries in their large\\nnumbers. The developing countries, which make up\\nthree quarters of the world’s population, should\\nbecome a key pillar of a multipolar world. Without\\ntheir extensive participation on an equal footing, there\\nwill be no democracy in international relations or a fair\\nand rational world order. Without their economic\\nrevitalization, there can be no common development of\\nall humankind to speak of.\\nWe should step up multilateral cooperation.\\nMultilateral cooperation in various forms should\\nbecome the principal vehicle in the handling of\\ninternational affairs. Countries should join hands in\\ntaking on global challenges through globalized\\ncooperation.\\nIn a multipolar world, countries should respect\\nand consult with one another politically, strive for\\ncommon development by helping one another\\neconomically, prosper together by drawing on one\\n29\\n\\nanother’s cultural strengths and jointly maintain\\nsecurity through mutual trust, thus working hand in\\nhand to realize the peace and prosperity of humankind.\\nMore than half a century ago, our forefathers\\ngathered to give birth to the United Nations. The past\\n58 years have seen the Organization’s notable\\naccomplishments in preserving peace in regions and\\naround the world and in promoting human development\\nand progress. The spirit of the United Nations\\nCharter — characterized by such words as “to live\\ntogether in peace with one another as good neighbours”\\nand “to promote social progress and better standards of\\nlife in large freedom” — has been widely accepted in\\nthe international community.\\nThe United Nations has become the most\\nuniversal, most representative and most authoritative\\ninternational organization in the world today. This is\\nwhat history affirms and what reality mandates.\\nChina maintains that in the current situation the\\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\\nshould be adhered to and earnestly abided by with a\\nview to realizing democracy, the rule of law in\\ninternational relations and the mutually advantageous\\ncoexistence of the countries of the world.\\nIn handling affairs affecting regional or\\ninternational peace, all Member States are obliged to\\nmaintain the leading role and authority of the United\\nNations and its Security Council. China is in favour of\\nan important role for the United Nations in Iraq’s post-\\nwar arrangements and reconstruction and supports the\\nrestoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people at an early\\ndate.\\nChina also supports the United Nations carrying\\nout the necessary reforms to enhance its role and\\neffectiveness in the light of changing circumstances.\\nThe United Nations is a microcosm of our world.\\nThe world’s hope rests on a strong United Nations. In\\norder to build a better future for humankind, it is\\nincumbent upon us first to turn the United Nations into\\na forum for cooperation instead of an arena of\\nrecrimination. No country is entirely populated by\\nsaints and therefore no country should have the right to\\nthrow the stones of prejudice.\\nTo that end, we should forsake all the old\\nbaggage of arrogance, estrangement and narrow-\\nmindedness and let harmony, understanding and\\ntolerance ring out loudly as the undiminished themes of\\nthis great Hall. The ocean is made great by all the\\nrivers it takes in. Let that be the motto of all Member\\nStates.\\nDevelopment is the foundation for world peace\\nand human progress. We stand for stronger\\ninternational cooperation and the achievement of\\ncommon development.\\nThe current state of affairs — in which the gap\\nbetween the North and the South has been widening\\nwithout pause, with some countries of the South\\nlanguishing in dire poverty — must be changed without\\nfurther delay. The key lies in establishing a fair and\\nequitable new world economic order in response to the\\nrequirements of economic globalization.\\nAn open and fair multilateral trading regime\\nshould be established and improved. The principles of\\nmutual understanding and mutual accommodation\\nshould be followed to bring about due progress in\\nmultilateral trade talks. Close attention should be given\\nto reforming and improving the international financial\\nsystem, setting up a financial early-warning mechanism\\nand enhancing the capacity of countries to prevent and\\ndeal with financial crises.\\nStronger South-South cooperation and North-\\nSouth exchanges should be promoted. The developing\\ncountries should step up their cooperation and\\ncoordination and gradually change their\\ndisadvantageous position in the economic globalization\\nprocess. This coming December, the second ministerial\\nconference of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum\\nwill be held in Addis Ababa, where the two sides will\\nwork together to deepen their equality-based and\\nmutually beneficial cooperation and open up a new\\nhorizon in South-South cooperation.\\nThe developed countries should also shoulder\\ntheir duties and responsibilities by giving greater\\nsupport to the developing countries in the areas of\\nmarket access, funding, technology transfer, debt relief\\nand trade terms.\\nAll human communities make an organic whole\\nwhen it comes to development. When hundreds of\\nmillions of fellow human beings are suffering from\\ncold and hunger, the rich countries should not nor\\ncannot enjoy their riches by themselves for long. The\\nstriking contrast in wealth is eroding the very dignity\\nthat all human beings share. Upon the monstrous gap\\n30\\n\\nbetween the North and South cannot stand the great\\nedifice of future prosperity.\\nWhile addressing the development issue, it is\\nnecessary to highlight the need for a harmonious\\ndevelopment of the economy and society.\\nAt present, humankind’s further development is\\nbeing increasingly hampered by excessive population\\ngrowth, environmental degradation, energy depletion,\\nthe decline and demise of indigenous cultures, and\\nother constraints. Sustainable development can be truly\\nrealized only when there is harmony, mutual\\ncomplementarity and mutual promotion between the\\neconomy and society, and between their development\\nand nature.\\nIn the first half of the year, SARS struck a\\nnumber of regions and countries, which testifies yet\\nagain to the crucial importance of public health in the\\ncontext of development. While countries should\\nstrengthen their public health systems, the world in\\ngeneral should enhance its capacity to deal with major\\ndiseases and disasters through an improved globalized\\ncontingency response mechanism.\\nThe Chinese Government supports the proposal\\nmade by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\\ncertain countries at the fifty-sixth World Health\\nAssembly for the establishment of a global fund\\nagainst SARS and is ready to contribute to it. We call\\non all countries to support the United Nations in its\\nrelevant activities, including incorporating public\\nhealth into United Nations development programmes\\nand other action plans and promoting regional and\\ninternational cooperation in this regard.\\nLast fall, the Communist Party of China convened\\nits 16th National Congress, which called for the\\nbuilding, during the first two decades of the twenty-\\nfirst century, of a society that is well off in all respects.\\nThis past spring, a new Chinese Central Government\\nwas elected at the 10th National People’s Congress —\\nthus a smooth leadership transition was realized.\\nIn the first half of the year, the people of China\\nput up a heroic fight against SARS and won a\\nresounding victory. Many friendly countries and\\npersonalities in the world, together with the World\\nHealth Organization and other United Nations\\nagencies, have rendered us valuable support and\\nassistance, for which I wish to express our heartfelt\\ngratitude.\\nChina has kept its economic growth in high gear.\\nThe first two quarters saw the nation’s gross domestic\\nproduct grow by 8.2 per cent over the corresponding\\nperiod of last year, and foreign trade grow by 39 per\\ncent. China’s economic efficiency has improved\\nmarkedly, and its reforms on all fronts are progressing\\nin an orderly way.\\nNeedless to say, China is a developing country. It\\nstill has a long way to go before all its citizens can live\\na comfortable, even affluent life. Development,\\ntherefore, remains China’s top priority.\\nChina’s development requires a peaceful\\ninternational and surrounding environment. We will\\ncontinue to pursue an independent foreign policy of\\npeace and will seek to play a constructive role in\\nregional and international affairs.\\nChina will continue to push for friendship and\\ngood-neighbourliness in the interest of peace and\\ntranquillity in the region. Based on our support for a\\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula on which peace and\\nstability should be maintained, we initiated and\\nsponsored the three-party Beijing talks and the first\\nround of six-party talks. China remains committed to\\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\\npeacefully through dialogue and the building of a\\nlasting peace there.\\nTo develop, China needs the world, and a\\nprosperous world also needs China. The market and\\ncooperation potential unleashed by a rapidly\\ndeveloping China could bring fresh and immeasurable\\nopportunities to the region and to the world at large.\\nWe desire peace, stability and development. We\\naspire to equality, mutual benefit and a win-win result\\nfor all. Conforming to the tide of history, China has\\nopted for the path of peaceful development, linking its\\nrejuvenation with that of the region, with the interests\\nof the majority of countries, and with the lofty cause of\\npeace and development for humanity. We hereby\\npledge our continued and ever-greater contribution to\\nworld prosperity and progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I\\noffer my warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your\\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\\nfifty-ninth session. I am confident that under your\\npresidency fruitful results will be achieved. I also wish\\nto pay a cordial tribute to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte,\\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\\nsession, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\\nThe recent appalling terror in Beslan, Russia,\\ncaused massive casualties, including many children.\\nOn behalf of the Chinese Government, I strongly\\ncondemn, once again, that inhuman act of terrorist\\nviolence and extend our deep condolences to the\\nfamilies of the victims.\\nPeace and development remain the dominant\\nthemes in today’s world. Multipolarization and\\neconomic globalization are moving forward in twists\\nand turns. Science and technology are advancing at a\\ndizzying speed. Forces that make for peace and factors\\nthat lead to war are both on the rise. Human society is\\nmoving in a bright, progressive and positive direction.\\nHowever, the light of peace has not fallen on\\nevery corner of the globe, nor has development reached\\nevery inch of the Earth. Threats to security, both\\ntraditional and non-traditional, are intertwined. The\\ndark cloud of war remains menacing. Hot spots keep\\nspringing up. Terrorist activities are raging, and cross-\\nborder problems such as the proliferation of weapons\\nof mass destruction, drug trafficking, transnational\\ncrime and illegal immigration are erupting one after\\nanother. Factors of uncertainty, instability and\\nunpredictability are increasing.\\nIn the course of economic globalization, the gap\\nbetween the North and the South is widening.\\nDeveloping countries are confronting new difficulties\\nand challenges as a growing number of them are\\nfurther marginalized. Today, half the global population\\nlives on less than $2 a day, and of those, 1.2 billion live\\non less than $1 a day. Much remains to be done to\\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals.\\nPeace, development and cooperation are the\\nprerequisites for our times. People all over the world\\nare raising their voice in favour of peace, development\\nand cooperation and against war, poverty and\\nconfrontation. Peace is the precondition for human\\ndevelopment and prosperity. Without a peaceful and\\nstable international environment, development is out of\\nthe question for any country. A chaotic world benefits\\nno one. Having experienced the scourge of two world\\nwars, mankind would not tolerate any more war or\\nbloodshed. Thus it is the fervent aspiration of all\\npeoples to live and achieve development in a secure\\nand stable environment.\\nIn tackling security issues, it is imperative to\\nfoster a new security concept of mutual trust, mutual\\nbenefit, equality and cooperation. This new concept\\ncalls for nations to transcend their differences in\\nideology and social systems, respect one another’s\\nsecurity interests, promote greater democracy in\\ninternational relations and seek peaceful solutions to\\ndisputes through dialogue.\\nTerrorism is the common enemy of the whole\\nworld. China stands firmly opposed to terrorism in all\\nforms and manifestations. To prevent and fight\\nterrorism, we must intensify international cooperation\\nand address both the causes and symptoms of the\\nthreat. Only when the root causes of terrorism are\\neradicated can peoples live in peace and tranquillity\\nagain.\\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nposes a threat to world peace and security. Non-\\nproliferation efforts therefore require the participation\\nof all members of the international community.\\nLikewise, it is important to discard unilateralism and\\ndouble standards and to give full credit and full latitude\\nto the role of the United Nations.\\nChina takes an active part in multilateral non-\\nproliferation efforts and firmly defends the\\ninternational regime of arms control, disarmament and\\nnon-proliferation treaties. China believes that\\nmultilateral arms control, disarmament and non-\\nproliferation processes can be steadily promoted in\\norder to further improve the international non-\\nproliferation regime.\\nThere is still a long way to go before peace and\\nreconstruction can be realized in Iraq. We support an\\nimportant role for the United Nations in Iraq’s political\\nprocess, helping that country achieve the smooth\\nholding of elections.\\n10\\n\\nWe appeal to Palestine and Israel to resume\\ndialogue as soon as possible and to start implementing\\nthe Middle East road map faithfully. As always, China\\nwill work to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean\\nPeninsula through dialogue and talks, in the interest of\\npeace and stability on the Peninsula.\\nDevelopment is the foundation for human\\nprogress. Lasting peace and stability throughout the\\nworld depends on coordinated, balanced and universal\\ndevelopment. Development is of overriding\\nimportance. Living in peace, abundance and harmony\\nbetween nations has been the dream of many\\ngenerations. Coordinated, balanced and sustainable\\ndevelopment serves the fundamental interests of all\\npeoples and works for their well-being.\\nIn order to promote economic growth worldwide,\\nit is necessary for the international community to take\\neffective measures to put in place an open and fair\\nmultilateral trading regime and gradually improve it. It\\nis also important to reform and improve the\\ninternational financial system.\\nThe developed countries must honour their\\ncommitments to debt reduction, technology transfer\\nand market access through concrete actions in order to\\nenable developing countries to really benefit from\\nglobalization. The developing countries, for their part,\\nneed to work together to attain development and take\\npart in a wide range of international efforts. They\\nshould also deepen South-South cooperation.\\nWe, the members of the international community,\\nshould join hands in working for a just and equitable\\nnew international economic order that meets the needs\\nof the growing economic globalization and serves the\\ncommon interests of all countries.\\nThe Millennium Development Goals are our\\nsolemn, collective pledge. The United Nations should\\nfurther mobilize resources, strengthen coordination and\\nincrease its input to development activities in order to\\nhelp Member States achieve these important goals as\\nscheduled.\\nCooperation is an effective way of dealing with\\nthe collective challenges facing humankind. To\\nstrengthen international cooperation, we must\\nchampion multilateralism. The United Nations is the\\ncentre of the international multilateral system and the\\nkey platform for making multilateralism work. It is the\\nwidespread desire of the international community to\\nadhere to the purposes and principles of the United\\nNations Charter, take more collective actions,\\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations and safeguard\\nits authority.\\nThe threats and challenges we face make it\\nimperative to strengthen, rather than weaken, the role\\nof the United Nations. A stronger United Nations is\\nindispensable for maintaining global peace and\\nstability and promoting the common development of\\nhumankind. All Member States should honour their\\ncommitments to the Charter of the United Nations and\\nfulfil their international responsibilities and\\nobligations.\\nThe world is eagerly looking forward to a\\ndynamic and action-oriented United Nations. China\\nsupports necessary and rational reforms of the\\nOrganization. Such reforms should aim at enhancing\\nthe leading role of the United Nations in international\\naffairs, reinforcing its capacity to tackle new threats\\nand challenges, and ensuring that better reflects the\\naspirations and needs of the vast majority of\\ndeveloping countries.\\nChina is in favour of expanding the Security\\nCouncil and of giving priority to greater representation\\nof the developing countries. China also supports the\\nwork of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\\nand Change, and it is looking forward to the Panel’s\\nreport by the end of this year, so that it can be reviewed\\nby Member States.\\nChina is a staunch force working for world peace,\\ncommon development and international cooperation.\\nAfter over half a century of strenuous efforts and more\\nthan two decades of reform and opening up, China has\\nnow entered a new stage of development aimed at\\nbuilding a moderately prosperous society all-round.\\nHowever, China is still a developing country, and a\\nlarge population and inadequate economic\\ndevelopment remain its basic national conditions. It\\nhas a long way to go before achieving its development\\ngoals.\\nThe Chinese Government will always place\\ndevelopment at the top of its agenda. The fact that\\nChina — a large, developing country with 1.3 billion\\npeople — runs its own affairs well is in itself a major\\ncontribution to peace and to the development of\\nhumanity.\\n11\\n\\nChina desires peace, development and\\ncooperation, and strives to win peace and development\\nthrough cooperation. It is working to promote\\ndemocracy in international relations, diversity in its\\nmodes of development and richness in the world’s\\ncivilizations. It advocates a new security concept and\\nfacilitates the establishment of a fair and equitable new\\ninternational order.\\nChina will pursue with determination an\\nindependent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the five\\nprinciples for Peaceful Coexistence, and engage in\\nmutually beneficial and friendly cooperation with other\\ncountries on an equal footing.\\nChina will unswervingly safeguard its\\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, brook no\\ninterference in its internal affairs by foreign forces and,\\nat the same time, respect other countries’ sovereignty\\nand territorial integrity.\\nChina remains committed to the common\\ninterests of humankind. China’s national interests, in\\nthe final analysis, are consistent with the common\\ninterests of all humankind. In handling State-to-State\\nrelations, China will safeguard its own interests while\\ntaking into account the interests of other countries.\\nChina will adhere to the policy of opening up, and\\ndevelop economic relations and trade with all other\\nnations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\\nChina’s development stands in the way of no one,\\nnor does it pose any threat to others. China is following\\nthe path of peaceful development, seeking an\\ninternational environment of peace and stability for its\\nown development and promoting world peace and\\nprogress through its own prosperity.\\nChina is working steadily to develop its relations\\nwith the world’s major countries. It will stay\\ncommitted to the policy of building friendship and\\npartnership with its neighbours and combine stronger\\nbilateral friendships with enhanced regional\\ncooperation. It will strengthen solidarity and\\ncooperation with other developing countries and\\nsupport any justified demands or legitimate\\npropositions on their part in international affairs. It will\\nplay a constructive role in the political, economic,\\nsocial, disarmament, arms control and other\\nmultilateral fields; safeguard the purposes and\\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the\\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\\nrelations; and support any consensus that serves the\\ncommon interests of all countries.\\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\\nSafeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial\\nintegrity and realizing complete national reunification\\nat an early date is the common will and firm resolve of\\nthe 1.3 billion Chinese people. Pursuing the policy of\\n“peaceful reunification and one country, two systems”,\\nthe Chinese Government is ready to work tirelessly\\ntowards a peaceful reunification with the utmost\\nsincerity. We, more than anyone else, want to see a\\npeaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. But we\\nwill never tolerate Taiwan independence, nor will we\\nallow anyone to separate Taiwan from the rest of China\\nin any way.\\nWe hope that the international community will\\nfully recognize the complex and sensitive nature of the\\ncurrent situation across the Taiwan Strait and the\\nserious threat posed by the separatist activities of the\\nTaiwan authorities to the stability of the Taiwan Strait\\nand the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. We expect the\\nAssembly to continue supporting the Chinese\\nGovernment’s efforts for peaceful reunification and to\\njoin us in containing pro-independence activities, in the\\ninterest of stability in the Strait and of world peace.\\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\\nFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As the basic\\nguidelines for State-to-State relations, the Five\\nPrinciples have withstood the test of half a century and\\nremain an irrefutable truth. The Five Principles, which\\ninclude peace, development and cooperation, are\\nconsistent with the purposes and principles of the\\nCharter of the United Nations. They provide guidance\\nfor the establishment and development of relations\\nbetween countries with identical or different social\\nsystems; point to the correct path towards the peaceful\\nsettlement of outstanding issues between countries and\\ninternational disputes; firmly defend the interests of the\\ndeveloping countries; and facilitate the improvement\\nand development of North-South relations. The Five\\nPrinciples present important ideas that must underpin\\nthe establishment of a fair and equitable new\\ninternational order.\\nChina not only initiated, but has faithfully\\nobserved, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.\\nGiven the new realities of today, we will continue to\\nchampion those Principles and join all the peoples of\\n12\\n\\nthe world in advancing the lofty cause of peace,\\ndevelopment and cooperation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I \\nwish to begin by congratulating you, Madam President, \\non your election as President of the General Assembly \\nat its sixty-first session. I am confident that, under your \\nguidance, this session will achieve full success. I also \\nwish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of the \\nlast session, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I \\nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate \\nthe Republic of Montenegro on becoming a Member of \\nthe United Nations. \\n The world is experiencing profound and complex \\nchanges. Peace, development and cooperation have \\nbecome trends of our times and represent the common \\naspirations of all countries and peoples in the world. \\nHowever, the world is not tranquil and the issue of \\ndevelopment remains prominent. There is still a long \\nway to go in the pursuit of durable peace and common \\ndevelopment. Recently, the nuclear issue on the Korean \\nPeninsula, the Iranian nuclear issue and the Lebanese-\\nIsraeli conflict have flared up, adversely affecting \\nregional and global stability and testing the wisdom, \\nunity and patience of the international community. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 22 \\n \\n To maintain peace is the shared mission of the \\nentire international community. Consultations based on \\nequality and peaceful negotiations are the only \\neffective means to resolve disputes. China, as a \\npermanent member of the Security Council and a \\nmember of the international community, will continue \\nto make every effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of \\nhotspot issues. \\n As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean \\nPeninsula, China is committed to maintaining peace \\nand stability on the Peninsula, making it free of nuclear \\nweapons and promoting the six-party talks. During the \\nSecurity Council’s deliberations in July regarding the \\nmissile tests by the Democratic People’s Republic of \\nKorea and the related resolution, China made strenuous \\nefforts to engage the parties concerned, in an effort to \\nmaintain peace on the Peninsula and in North-East Asia \\nand preserve the unity and authority of the Security \\nCouncil and safeguard the progress already made in the \\nsix-party talks. \\n Long-standing antagonism and mistrust between \\nthe parties concerned is the main cause of the current \\ndifficulty. All parties should be patient and pragmatic \\nand act with vision to reduce differences and remove \\nobstacles through dialogue. The six-party talks remain \\nan effective mechanism to enhance understanding and \\ntrust and resolve the Korean nuclear issue. We hope \\nthat the parties involved will be cool-headed and more \\nflexible, expand common ground, meet each other \\nhalfway and work together for the early resumption of \\nthe six-party talks and progressive implementation of \\nthe joint statement. That is the only viable solution to \\nthe Korean nuclear issue. \\n With respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, China \\ncalls for upholding the integrity of the international \\nnuclear non-proliferation regime, and is opposed to the \\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It has worked for a \\npeaceful resolution of the issue in order to promote \\npeace and stability in the Middle East. At the same \\ntime, the legitimate right of countries to the peaceful \\nuse of nuclear energy should be fully respected, \\nprovided they fulfil their relevant international \\nobligations. \\n Diplomatic negotiation represents the best chance \\nto resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and serve the \\ninterests of all parties. China hopes that the parties \\ninvolved will exercise patience and restraint, continue \\nto take a flexible approach and remain committed to \\nthe right course of pursuing a peaceful resolution. \\nChina will continue to play a constructive role in \\nworking for an appropriate settlement of the Iranian \\nnuclear issue. \\n As regards the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, China \\nopposes any move that will undermine peace and \\nstability in the region, and calls for a comprehensive \\ncessation of hostilities. China welcomes Security \\nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and hopes that it will \\nbe strictly observed. China hopes that the parties \\nconcerned will reach an early agreement on a \\nframework of political settlement that is both just and \\ndurable. \\n The question of Palestine is at the core of the \\nMiddle East issue. The peace process should be re-\\nstarted in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the \\nUnited Nations and the principle of land for peace, in \\nthe interest of reaching an early and comprehensive \\nsettlement of the Middle East issue, including the \\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, so that the countries \\ninvolved can live in harmony and the region can enjoy \\ndurable peace. \\n The United Nations has played an instrumental \\nrole in resolving regional flashpoints this year. But the \\nOrganization also faces major challenges. In the new \\ninternational environment, to enhance its role through \\nreform is in the common interest of humankind. The \\nUnited Nations needs to take resolute steps in carrying \\nout reform. The United Nations should develop in a \\nway that promotes the purposes and principles of its \\nCharter, upholds the unity and cooperation of the \\nOrganization and serves the collective interests of its \\nMembers. The reform of the United Nations should be \\ncomprehensive in coverage, and progress should be \\nmade in security, development, human rights and other \\nfields. More should be done to promote development \\nand facilitate the realization of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. The reform of the Organization \\nshould, as far as possible, satisfy the needs of its \\nMember States, particularly those from the developing \\nworld. The reform should be a democratic process and \\nfull consultations should be conducted to reach \\nwidespread consensus. Major controversial issues \\nshould be handled with caution and dealt with through \\nin-depth consultations. \\n China welcomes the progress made in reforming \\nthe United Nations, in particular the progress in \\nimplementing the World Summit Outcome. We will \\n \\n \\n23 06-53317 \\n \\npledge $3 million to the United Nations Peacebuilding \\nFund. We will continue to work with other countries to \\nmake progress in the reform of the United Nations, \\nstrengthen the unity and authority of the Organization \\nand increase its efficiency and capacity to respond to \\nchallenges. \\n As the chief administrator of the United Nations, \\nthe Secretary-General has an important role to play. In \\nthe election of the next Secretary-General, China will \\nfirmly support an Asian candidate. We are convinced \\nthat Asia can produce a competent and well-respected \\nSecretary-General acceptable to all Member States. \\n The scale of assessments for the apportionment of \\nthe expenses of the United Nations involves the \\ninterests of all Member States and constitutes the \\nfinancial foundation of the Organization. All Member \\nStates have an obligation to pay their assessments on \\ntime and in full. The ability to pay is the basic \\nprinciple governing the scale of assessments. It should \\nbe adhered to, as it has proved effective and represents \\nthe general consensus of Member States. Over the \\nyears, China has honoured its financial obligations in \\ngood faith and has made appropriate contributions to \\nthe budget of the United Nations. As China’s economy \\ngrows, we are prepared to increase our contributions to \\nthe Organization’s budget in accordance with the \\nprinciple of ability to pay. We are ready to take part in \\nrelevant discussions in a constructive way, and hope \\nthat a fair and equitable formula will be reached on the \\nbasis of extensive consultations. \\n Without overall development, global peace and \\nprogress cannot be sustained. In addition to developing \\nthe concept of partnership and improving its \\nmodalities, all countries should honour our \\ncommitment to the global partnership for development \\nset out in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \\nConsensus, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation \\nand last year’s World Summit Outcome.  \\n Countries should shoulder the primary \\nresponsibility for their own development and \\nimplement comprehensive development strategies in \\nkeeping with the Millennium Development Goals \\n(MDGs). \\n The international community — and developed \\ncountries in particular — should increase development \\nassistance, promote international trade, technology \\ntransfers and investment, offer more extensive debt \\nrelief, provide more support to developing countries \\nand respect their ownership of national development \\nstrategies. \\n The United Nations should play a bigger role in \\nthe field of development. It should create a fair and \\nequitable framework to assess progress in meeting the \\nMDGs and ensure that the United Nations Foundation \\nand the various United Nations programmes and \\nspecialized agencies provide greater support for \\ncapacity-building programmes in developing countries. \\nIt should enhance coordination between international \\ndevelopment policy and monetary, financial and \\ntrading regimes and create an enabling international \\nenvironment for developing countries. \\n The suspension of the Doha round serves \\nnobody’s interests. Members of the World Trade \\nOrganization should demonstrate political will, \\nspeedily resume the Doha development round and \\nwork towards a comprehensive and balanced outcome. \\n Non-governmental organizations should be \\nencouraged to be more extensively and deeply involved \\nin development cooperation. Their efforts and those of \\nGovernments should complement each other. \\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \\nechoes the calling of our times. Member States have a \\ncommon responsibility to make the Council a dynamic \\nand effective body. The Council should give greater \\nattention to massive and gross violations of human \\nrights caused by armed conflicts and should support \\nthe international community in its efforts to prevent \\nconflicts, restore peace and combat terrorism in all its \\nforms and manifestations. \\n The Council should attach equal importance to \\neconomic, social and cultural rights and encourage the \\ninternational community and United Nations agencies \\nto take effective measures to support countries in their \\nefforts to realize their right to development.  \\n The Council should continue to give special \\nattention to the rights of women, children, persons with \\ndisabilities, migrant workers, ethnic minorities and \\nother vulnerable groups to ensure that they enjoy the \\nsame level of respect as others. \\n The Council should promote dialogue and \\ncooperation on an equal footing between countries of \\ndifferent social systems and levels of development, \\naddress human rights issues properly and reject double \\nstandards and politicization. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 24 \\n \\n For decades, relations between China and African \\ncountries have been characterized by sincerity and \\nmutual support. We have conducted our cooperation on \\nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit, while \\nsafeguarding sovereignty and independence and \\npromoting social and economic development in our \\nrespective countries. All that has served to bring about \\nsignificant benefits for the Chinese and African peoples \\nalike. \\n China and Africa will hold a summit and the third \\nministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa \\nCooperation in Beijing from 3 to 5 November. \\nFocusing on the theme of friendship, peace, \\ncooperation and development, Chinese and African \\nleaders will discuss ways to establish and foster a new \\ntype of strategic partnership featuring political equality \\nand mutual trust, win-win economic cooperation and \\ncultural exchanges. They will also draft a blueprint to \\nenhance China-Africa cooperation. China is committed \\nto peaceful development. Africa, which is home to the \\nlargest number of developing countries, is committed \\nto achieving stability and renewal. Stronger ties \\nbetween China and Africa will contribute to South-\\nSouth cooperation and international peace and \\ndevelopment. \\n The conduct of China’s diplomacy aims to \\nsafeguard world peace and promote common \\ndevelopment. China is committed to developing itself \\nthrough safeguarding and promoting world peace \\nthrough its own development. We are pursuing \\ndevelopment that is peaceful, inclusive, cooperative \\nand harmonious in nature. We will endeavour to \\npromote the fundamental interests of our own people in \\nharmony with the common interests of other peoples \\nand to pursue peace, promote development and resolve \\ndisputes through cooperation. \\n China is dedicated to building a harmonious \\nworld. It hopes to increase mutual respect and \\nunderstanding with other countries and to live in \\nharmony with them. China respects the right of a \\ncountry to choose its own path to development. It \\nsupports equal participation by different countries in \\ninternational affairs and democracy in international \\nrelations. It works to enhance mutual benefits, win-win \\noutcomes and global prosperity through sharing the \\nbenefits of economic globalization and technological \\nprogress. China seeks to promote a diversified world \\nand advance human civilization by furthering dialogue, \\nunderstanding and mutual enrichment between \\ndifferent cultures. China is committed to advancing \\nhuman progress by enhancing dialogue, building \\nmutual trust with other countries and working with \\nthem to address global issues. \\n China will continue to demonstrate to the world \\nthat it is an important force for global peace and \\ndevelopment and that the Chinese people will remain \\ntrustworthy friends and cooperation partners to the \\nworld’s peoples.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I  wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \\nsession. I am convinced that under your able \\nleadership, the current session will be a fruitful one. I \\nalso wish to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for \\nher contribution during her presidency of the previous \\nsession. \\n The current international environment is highly \\ncomplex. Mankind is facing both unprecedented \\nopportunities and challenges. There is a growing trend \\ntowards peace, development and cooperation in the \\nworld. But, on the other hand, traditional and non-\\ntraditional security threats are intertwined; hotspot \\nissues are acute; the gap between the North and South \\nis widening; trade protectionism is resurfacing; and \\ndeveloping countries generally remain in a \\ndisadvantaged position. The steady trend towards \\neconomic globalization and towards a multi-polar \\nworld is fostering a new way of thinking about \\ninternational relations. \\n In this Hall two years ago, Chinese President Hu \\nJintao called on mankind to build a harmonious world \\nwith lasting peace and common prosperity in the \\ntwenty-first century (see A/60/PV.5). The core message \\nof his call is that, while recognizing the diversity of the \\nworld, differences of interests and diversity of cultures, \\nwe should harmonize interests, defuse conflicts and \\npromote cooperation for win-win progress in a \\npeaceful and cooperative manner. \\n In its 62-year history, the United Nations has \\nplayed an irreplaceable role in promoting humankind’s \\ncause of peace and development. The current session of \\nthe General Assembly should focus on promoting \\nharmonious coexistence among countries. Resolving \\nhotspot issues and peacefully settling international \\ndisputes through dialogue and cooperation are not only \\nexplicitly called for by the United Nations Charter. \\nThey are also the right way to uphold world peace and \\nstability and achieve mutual benefit and a win-win \\nsituation for all. \\n China remains committed to seeking a peaceful \\nsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula \\nthrough dialogue to uphold peace and stability on the \\npeninsula and throughout North-East Asia. The Six-\\nParty Talks have become an important platform for the \\nparties concerned to maintain dialogue and \\nconsultations on achieving denuclearization on the \\npeninsula, normalizing relations between the countries \\nconcerned and building a new harmonious architecture \\nin North-East Asia. We will continue to play a \\nconstructive role in advancing the process of the Six-\\nParty Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean \\npeninsula. \\n Diplomatic negotiations are the best option for \\nresolving the Iranian nuclear issue peacefully and \\nmeeting the common interests of the international \\ncommunity. China opposes nuclear-weapon \\nproliferation and stands for upholding the international \\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and \\nstability in the Middle East. No non-proliferation effort \\nshould deviate from the goal of upholding international \\npeace and stability. Countries should honour their due \\ninternational obligations, and their right to peaceful use \\nof nuclear energy should be fully respected. China \\nurges the parties concerned to show flexibility and \\nresume negotiations at an early date. China will \\ncontinue to contribute its share to the peaceful \\nsettlement of the Iranian nuclear issue. \\n The Palestine-Israel conflict is at the core of the \\nMiddle East issue. China supports the just cause of the \\nPalestinian and other Arab peoples and the restoration \\nof their lawful national rights, and it sincerely hopes \\nthat Arab countries and Israel will promptly end their \\ndisputes through political negotiations on the basis of \\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of \\nland for peace. China calls on Palestine to strengthen \\nits unity and welcomes the initiative to hold an \\ninternational conference on the Middle East. We hope \\nthat the Iraqi people will continue to work for national \\nreconciliation and restore peace and stability at an \\nearly date, and that this will lead to a comprehensive, \\njust and lasting resolution of the Middle East issue. \\n The trilateral dialogue and consultation among \\nthe United Nations, the African Union and the \\nSudanese Government on an equal footing is an \\neffective mechanism for resolving the Darfur issue. \\nThe international community should work to sustain \\nthe current sound momentum and give full play to the \\nrole of the trilateral mechanism as the main channel. \\nWe should adhere to dual-track strategy, promote \\nbalanced progress in peacekeeping operations and the \\npolitical process and seek a lasting solution to the \\nDarfur issue through making progress in the security, \\npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social areas. \\nChina is committed to a proper settlement of the Darfur \\nissue. It has provided humanitarian assistance to Darfur \\non a number of occasions and will send a military \\nengineering unit to join the peacekeeping operations \\nthere. China will continue to firmly support the peace \\nand national reconciliation process in the Sudan and \\nwill contribute to the resolution of the Darfur issue and \\npeace, stability and development in the Sudan. \\n At its current session, the General Assembly \\nshould promote the peaceful development of all \\ncountries. Poverty is a major source of disputes, and \\nonly development can eliminate poverty. Human \\ndevelopment concerns us all. Obviously, it is \\nimpossible to build common prosperity when there is a \\nhuge chasm between the North and the South. The \\ninternational community should act with a sense of \\nurgency and redouble its efforts to deliver the \\nMillennium Development Goals, narrow the North-\\nSouth gap and, in particular, meet Africa’s special \\ndevelopment needs. Developed countries should \\nincrease assistance, further open their domestic \\nmarkets, transfer more technologies to developing \\ncountries and provide greater debt relief to them. \\n For their part, developing countries, on their part, \\nshould adopt development strategies and policies \\nsuited to their national conditions and boost their \\neconomic development. We should support an open, \\nequitable and fair multilateral trade regime and oppose \\ntrade protectionism. We should work for an early, \\ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \\nRound negotiations and make it a development round. \\nReform of the international economic system should \\nfully reflect changes in the world economy and should \\ngive developing countries more say and greater \\nrepresentation in the international economic system. \\n China gives a high priority to strengthening \\ninternational cooperation on development as it \\ndevelops itself. We seek coordinated and balanced \\nglobal development. While a developing country itself, \\nChina has all along provided assistance to African \\ncountries and other developing countries, according to \\nits ability, and has helped them to improve their \\ncapacity for independent and sustainable development. \\nThat is because we believe that lasting peace and the \\ncommon prosperity of the world is possible only with \\nthe development of developing countries. \\n To help Africa attain stability, security and \\nsustainable development is the common responsibility \\nof the international community. China and African \\ncountries enjoy mutual political respect and equality \\nand economic mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. \\nThey support one another and maintain close \\nconsultation in international affairs. We draw on one \\nanother’s strengths in governance to promote \\ndevelopment. Thanks to our joint efforts, China-Africa \\ncooperation has yielded fruitful results. Such \\ncooperation is well received by the African countries, \\nand it has brought great benefits to both the Chinese \\nand African peoples. China’s cooperation with Africa \\nfacilitates Africa’s cooperation with other countries and \\nis not targeted against any third party. \\n The current session of the General Assembly \\nshould be devoted to promoting harmony between man \\nand nature. Development in the world has both \\nadvanced material progress and caused ecological \\nimbalance and environmental pollution. To protect our \\ncommon homeland is a matter of vital importance for \\nour common future. \\n Climate change is an environmental issue, but \\nultimately it is an issue of development. It has arisen in \\nthe course of development and can be resolved only \\nthrough development. We should uphold the \\nframework of the United Nations Framework \\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \\nand adhere to the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities. Developed countries \\nshould face up to their responsibilities, fulfil their \\ncommitments on emissions reduction in earnest and \\ncontinue to take the lead in emissions reduction after \\n2012. We should strengthen international cooperation \\non energy, resources and the environment, step up \\nefforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving \\ntechnologies, environmental protection technologies \\nand low-carbon energy technologies, and establish \\nreasonable mechanisms for financing and technology \\ntransfer. That will enable developing countries to gain \\naccess to and afford advanced environmental-\\nprotection technologies, enhance capacity to respond to \\nclimate change and effectively address climate change \\nthrough achieving sustainable development. \\n China takes climate change seriously. Though its \\ncurrent per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less \\nthan one third of the average of developed countries, \\nChina, acting in a way that is highly responsible to \\nmankind, has taken many effective measures to tackle \\nclimate change, including adopting a series of laws and \\nregulations and setting the goals of reducing energy \\nintensity and increasing forest cover. The Chinese \\nGovernment has set the following targets: to reduce \\nenergy intensity and total discharge of major pollutants \\nby about 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively and \\nto increase the forest cover rate to 20 per cent for the \\nperiod between the end of 2005 and 2010. Under its \\nNational Climate Change Programme, China will take \\nan active part in international cooperation in climate \\nchange and contribute its share to protecting the global \\nclimate. \\n Advancing United Nations reform and enabling \\nthe Organization to play a more important role in \\nmaintaining world peace, promoting common \\ndevelopment and strengthening cooperation among \\ncountries is crucial to building a harmonious world. \\nChina supports the reform of the United Nations. The \\nreform decisions made at the high-level meeting \\nmarking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations \\nheld in 2005 should be implemented in a \\ncomprehensive and balanced manner. Priority should \\nbe given to reform in the area of development, and the \\nUnited Nations should increase its input in that area. \\nThe Human Rights Council should build on the \\noutcome of reform in its previous phase and become a \\nplatform for dialogue and cooperation rather than an \\narena for political confrontation. Security Council \\nreform should give priority to increasing the \\nrepresentation of developing countries and give small \\nand medium-sized countries more opportunities to \\nparticipate in decision-making. Reform proposals \\nshould be based on the widest possible consensus. \\nChina is ready to work with all other parties to turn \\nreform into a process of strengthening consultation and \\ndialogue and promoting solidarity and cooperation \\namong all United Nations Member States. \\n China is committed to building a society of \\ndemocracy, the rule of law, equity and justice, integrity \\nand amity, vitality, stability and order, where people \\nlive in harmony with nature. To achieve that goal, \\nChina is fully implementing the outcomes of scientific \\nthinking on development. We are working to boost \\nsocial productivity and ensure people’s rights in the \\npolitical, economic, cultural, social and other fields. By \\nstriving to build a harmonious society and by \\nimproving the material and cultural life of one fifth of \\nthe world’s population, China is making a true \\ncontribution to the building of a harmonious world. \\n China has always pursued its own development as \\na part of the global effort to promote the common \\nprogress of mankind. In international affairs, we are \\ncommitted to the following goals: promoting \\nparticipation in international affairs by all countries on \\nan equal footing and democracy in international \\nrelations; enabling all countries to share the benefits of \\neconomic globalization and progress in science and \\ntechnology for a win-win outcome; promoting \\nexchanges and understanding among civilizations and \\ndiversity in the world; enhancing dialogue and trust \\namong countries; and jointly tackling global issues. \\nChina unswervingly pursues a path of peaceful \\ndevelopment and will continue to make further \\ncontributions to humankind’s cause of peace and \\ndevelopment. \\n Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. \\nWe will not permit any challenge to the one-China \\nprinciple and General Assembly resolution 2758 \\n(XXVI). For 15 years running, since 1993, the General \\nAssembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related \\nissues in the agenda of the General Assembly session. \\nThis fully demonstrates that any move that runs \\ncounter to the purposes and principles of the United \\nNations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General \\nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any \\nsupport from the United Nations Member States and is \\ndoomed to failure. We hope that the countries \\nconcerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated \\nby the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong \\nmoves of this kind. \\nThe Taiwan authorities are now obstinately \\nclinging to the separatist course of “Taiwan \\nindependence” and are trying by all means to secure a \\nreferendum on applying for membership of the United \\nNations under the name Taiwan. This is another \\ndangerous step towards “de jure Taiwan independence” \\ntaken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked, \\nthis move will gravely endanger peace and stability \\nacross the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region. \\nThe Chinese Government has always made every effort \\nto promote with all sincerity peaceful development of \\ncross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful \\nreunification. However, we will never allow anyone to \\nseparate Taiwan from China in name or in any other \\nway. We hope that the international community will \\ncontinue to support China’s cause of peaceful \\nreunification, support the Chinese people in opposing \\nand repulsing separatist activities for “Taiwan \\nindependence” and work with us to maintain peace and \\nstability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-\\nPacific region. \\n The Olympic Games, which represent humanity’s \\naspiration for peace, development, cooperation and \\nfriendship, will for the first time be held in China, a \\ncountry both ancient and youthful, starting on 8 August \\n2008. One World, One Dream   this is the theme of \\nthe Beijing Olympic Games. The 1.3 billion people in \\nChina, together with the rest of the world, are eagerly \\nlooking forward to the opening of the Games. The \\n2008 Olympic Games are a great event for both the \\nChinese people and the other peoples of the world. We \\nare confident that with the efforts made by the Chinese \\npeople and with strong support from the international \\ncommunity, the 2008 Olympic Games will stand out as \\na highly successful event. \\n</td>\n",

I am confident that under your\\nguidance this session will achieve fruitful results. I also\\nwish to take this opportunity to express my sincere\\nrespects to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the previous\\nsession, and to the Secretary-General.\\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\\nend of the world war against fascism and the founding\\nof the United Nations. Just a few days ago in this Hall,\\nworld leaders solemnly adopted the outcome document\\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1).\\nNow, it falls to us to fulfil the important and pressing\\ntask of working towards a harmonious world of lasting\\npeace and common prosperity by translating that\\ndocument into action and turning fine words into\\nreality. This session should serve to promote peace,\\nharmony and common development.\\nWe want peaceful development. Progress of\\nmankind needs a peaceful environment. Stability and\\nsecurity of one country cannot be built on the\\nturbulence or crisis of another. Only a new security\\nconcept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality\\nand coordination will enable us to develop in peace and\\nsafeguard peace through development.\\nWe want harmonious development. To build a\\nbetter future is the long-cherished dream of mankind.\\nAny development strategy should be guided by a long-\\nterm and holistic perspective instead of immediate and\\nsectoral benefits. Therefore, we should work together\\nfor more democratic and law-based international\\nrelations and a harmonious environment in which\\ncountries respect one another, treat one another as\\nequals, and in which different cultures can emulate and\\ninterchange with each other.\\n18\\n\\nWe want common development. No model of\\ndevelopment that benefits only a few countries or a\\nsmall group of people is acceptable or sustainable.\\nCountries should cooperate with each other more\\nclosely so that economic globalization may yield\\nsuccessful results, benefit-sharing and common\\nprosperity.\\nThis session should serve to push forward\\nreforms of the United Nations and strengthen its role.\\nHaving weathered 60 years of vicissitudes, the United\\nNations needs multifaceted and multidimensional\\nreforms so as to be able to make a greater contribution\\nto mankind’s noble cause of peace and development.\\nThe position of the United Nations as the core of\\nthe world collective security mechanism must be\\nstrengthened so that it can perform its duty of\\nsafeguarding peace in a more effective way. China\\nsupports the efforts to enhance the Organization’s\\ncapacity on conflict prevention, mediation and good\\noffices. We also favour a greater role by the Secretary-\\nGeneral in this respect and the fostering of a preventive\\nculture.\\nWe support the efforts to strengthen United\\nNations peacekeeping operations, particularly with\\nregard to rapid deployment capacity and strategic\\npreparedness, as well as the capacity to fully mobilize\\nregional organizations and their resources under the\\nleadership of the Security Council.\\nChina supports the establishment of a\\nPeacebuilding Commission to more effectively\\ncoordinate United Nations efforts in the areas of\\npeacekeeping, post-conflict rehabilitation and\\ndevelopment. In that respect, the Economic and Social\\nCouncil and other development assistance agencies\\nshould have an important role to play in the\\nCommission.\\nIt has been our consistent position to oppose the\\nuse or threat of force in international relations. We do\\nnot support the reinterpretation or revision of the\\nprovisions in the Charter of the United Nations related\\nto the right of self-defence. Should an occasion arise\\nthat calls for the use of force, it is the Security Council\\nthat should make sound judgements and take prudent\\ndecisions as to the merits of the situation.\\nThe international community should continue to\\npress ahead with the international process on arms\\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation; safeguard\\nand enhance the authority and effectiveness of existing\\nmultilateral treaties; give full scope to the role of the\\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\\nthe area of non-proliferation; and seek solutions to\\nrelated issues by political and diplomatic means.\\nThe United Nations should be able to cope more\\neffectively with non-traditional security threats. We\\nwelcome the comprehensive strategy on counter-\\nterrorism proposed by the Secretary-General, and we\\nhope to see the early conclusion of a comprehensive\\nconvention on international terrorism, taking full\\naccount of the concerns of various parties, particularly\\ndeveloping countries.\\nIn the effort to reduce and prevent large-scale\\nhumanitarian crises, the international community\\nshould strictly observe the United Nations Charter,\\nrespect the opinions of the countries or organizations\\nconcerned and, with the Security Council’s\\nauthorization, explore, to the greatest extent possible,\\npeaceful settlement within the United Nations\\nframework. We oppose any rash intervention carried\\nout on the basis of the claim that a nation is unable or\\nunwilling to protect its own citizens.\\nDevelopment should be a main focus of United\\nNations reform. Although China is a low-income\\ndeveloping country, it is prepared to contribute as\\nmuch as it can to international cooperation for\\ndevelopment. As President Hu Jintao announced at the\\nsummit, China will take substantive steps in five areas.\\nWe will join hands with all Members to advance\\nreforms in the area of development so as to facilitate\\nthe resolution of development issues. The United\\nNations should put in place a fair and rational\\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) review\\nframework to assess progress made in various\\ncountries and to monitor follow-up of international\\ncooperation and aid commitments. We support the\\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council\\nin development-related areas.\\nThe Doha Round should embody development in\\nits focus, paying more attention and taking actions to\\naddress the concerns of developing countries,\\nparticularly with regard to agricultural produce and\\nspecial and differential treatment. China has decided to\\ngrant zero-tariff treatment to some commodities from\\n39 least developed countries, which will cover the\\nmajority of China’s imports from those countries.\\n19\\n\\nChina is in favour of incorporating the prevention\\nand treatment of HIV/AIDS and the building of the\\npublic health sector into the development programmes\\nand activities of various countries and of the United\\nNations. We will be submitting at the current session a\\ndraft resolution on strengthening global capacity-\\nbuilding in the area of public health. In the next three\\nyears, we plan to provide more aid and medicine to\\ndeveloping countries for preventing and treating\\nmalaria and other communicable diseases and to help\\nthem establish and reform their public health systems\\nand train medical personnel.\\nThe international community — particularly\\ndeveloped countries — should take substantive steps to\\nhelp developing countries break the vicious circle of\\ndebt. Such steps include substantial debt reduction and\\nthe streamlining of debt relief procedures and\\nrequirements. In the next two years, China will write\\noff or otherwise cancel the overdue portions, as of the\\nend of 2004, of interest-free or low-interest\\nGovernment loans owed by all heavily indebted poor\\ncountries having diplomatic relations with China.\\nWe call on the United Nations to give priority to\\nhelping developing countries to strengthen their\\ncapacity-building. China will help developing\\ncountries train 30,000 people for various professions in\\nthe next three years.\\nMy country also favours setting a timetable for\\ndeveloped countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their\\ngross national income to official development\\nassistance. New fund-raising methods should be\\nexplored so as to put more funds into development.\\nChina pledges $10 billion in concessional loans\\nto developing countries in the next three years within\\nthe framework of South-South cooperation.\\nThe Charter of the United Nations grants the\\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the\\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A\\nhighly efficient, responsible and representative Council\\nserves the long-term interests of the United Nations\\nand the common interests of all its Member States.\\nChina supports reform of the Security Council\\naimed at strengthening its authority and efficiency and\\nimproving its working methods. The representation of\\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\\nshould be increased so that small and medium-sized\\ncountries would have more say in the Council’s\\ndecision-making. No reform proposal can work that\\naddresses only the concerns of a few countries,\\ndisregarding the interests of the majority of countries,\\nand treats developing countries in Africa and in other\\nparts of the world unfairly.\\nChina supports the principle of cooperation based\\non democratic consultation. As reform will affect the\\nfuture of the United Nations and the interests of\\nvarious parties, there should be no artificial timeframes\\nor attempts to force decisions through a vote. Instead,\\nMember States should seek consensus through dialogue\\nand consultation and in accordance with the principle\\nof democratic international relations.\\nChina embraces the spirit of unity and\\ncooperation. The United Nations family has 191\\nMembers. Unity is the source of strength. We want\\nunity, not division. As long as Member States respect\\none another’s interests, accommodate one another’s\\nconcerns and show pragmatism and flexibility, we will\\nbe able to find a reform path that is acceptable to all.\\nThe current session should focus on Africa.\\nAfrican countries make up a quarter of the United\\nNations membership, and their populations account for\\n13 per cent of the world’s total population. If there is\\nno stability in Africa, the world will have no peace. If\\nAfrica remains poor, there will be no development for\\nthe world. The outcome document of the summit calls\\nfor efforts to meet the special needs of Africa. I believe\\nthat that is correct and necessary.\\nDespite the gratifying progress made in Africa in\\nrecent years, conflicts in some of its regions have\\npersisted. The Security Council should pay special\\nattention to African problems and give them priority on\\nits agenda. That means not only devoting more Council\\nmeetings to African issues, but also, and more\\nimportant, taking concrete actions to heed Africa’s\\nvoice, respect its views and accommodate its concerns.\\nChina applauds the mediation and good offices of\\nthe African Union and other regional organizations\\naimed at conflict settlement in Africa. We support\\nclose cooperation between the Security Council and\\nthose organizations by providing them with funds,\\nlogistics and technical assistance to strengthen their\\npeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction\\ncapacities.\\nAfrican countries face difficulties in the area of\\ndevelopment, particularly in attaining the MDGs. More\\n20\\n\\nthan 300 million people are still living under the\\npoverty line. One third of all children are\\nmalnourished. More than 30 million people are\\nsuffering from HIV/AIDS. With less than 2 per cent of\\nthe world’s economic aggregate, Africa is weighed\\ndown by debts amounting to $300 billion. All of that\\nposes a challenge to the conscience of mankind.\\nThe international community should reach a\\nglobal consensus on African development and help the\\ncontinent to achieve the MDGs on schedule by\\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s\\nDevelopment. Those who provide assistance must do\\nso in all sincerity and respect the right of African\\ncountries to make their own decisions. Assistance must\\nalso have a clear aim: to meet the basic and long-term\\nneeds of the African people. Assistance is by no means\\ncharity or a gift; it is a response to the call for mutual\\nbenefit and common development. Furthermore, it is\\nour moral duty to help the needy and redress injustices.\\nIn the twentieth century, Africa shook off\\ncolonial rule and achieved national liberation. That was\\nan epoch-making event. The twenty-first century will\\nbring peace and development to Africa — it is\\nhistorically inevitable. The Chinese people will\\ncontinue to stand beside their African brothers and\\nsisters on that journey of historic significance.\\nThe recently concluded Six-Party Talks in Beijing\\non the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have reached an\\nimportant consensus and issued a joint declaration,\\nmarking an important step forward in the Talks and a\\ncrystallization of the political will and diligence of the\\nparties concerned. It also reflects the common\\naspiration of the international community. Because it\\nwas so hard-won, this result needs to be especially\\nprized. We hope that the parties will continue to work\\ntogether to promote further progress in the Six-Party\\nTalks, resolve the nuclear issue on the Peninsula\\nthrough dialogue and by peaceful means, ensure lasting\\npeace and stability in the region and realize its\\ncommon goals for development and prosperity. The\\nChinese Government will continue to make a positive\\ncontribution in that regard.   \n",

I would also like\\nto thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his valuable contribution as\\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\\nI also take this opportunity to express my\\nheartfelt condolences on the recent tragic deaths in\\nBaghdad of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\\nother United Nations staff members.\\nThe twenty-first century is about to complete its\\nthird year, with hope and distress coexisting side by\\n28\\n\\nside. Peace and development remain the overriding\\nthemes of the times and the shared aspirations of\\npeople of all races, colours and nationalities. The\\nconcept of democracy and equality has planted deep\\nroots in the hearts of the people. The shared\\nconfrontation of global challenges through stronger\\ncoordination and cooperation has become the\\nconsensus of the international community.\\nCountries are increasingly closer in their\\neconomic relations. Advanced means of\\ncommunications have made it possible to share\\ninformation in real time. With their interests closely\\nconnected and intertwined, countries are finding\\nthemselves more and more like passengers in the same\\nboat. Regional cooperation has grown substantially in\\nboth depth and scope, with cooperation mechanisms\\ntaking shape at various levels. Regional economic\\nintegration is forging ahead in many parts of the world.\\nThere are, however, many worrisome aspects of\\nthe international situation. Local wars and conflicts\\ncontinue to emerge sporadically. Although the Iraq war\\nis over, peace remains elusive, with no end of suffering\\nin sight for the Iraqi people. With the situation between\\nIsrael and Palestine still experiencing ups and downs,\\nthe Middle East peace process remains a long, uphill\\njourney. In Africa, wars are still raging in some\\ncountries.\\nNon-traditional security concerns such as\\nterrorism, drug-trafficking, arms proliferation, the\\nspread of diseases and environmental degradation have\\nbecome more pronounced. Given modern conditions,\\nthey can easily spread within regions or even across the\\nworld, making the security situation of human\\ncommunities even more complicated.\\nHumankind still confronts severe challenges in its\\ndevelopment. In the past 30 years, the number of least\\ndeveloped countries has doubled, reaching 50, which\\naccounts for one quarter of the United Nations\\nmembership. The ever-widening gap between the North\\nand South and the aggravated disparity between the\\nrich and the poor have become a major factor breeding\\nnew conflicts and wars and undermining regional\\nstability.\\nAt a moment like this, people are inevitably\\npondering the same question: in the interest of world\\npeace and common development, what kind of new\\nworld order should we establish in the twenty-first\\ncentury?\\nChina is of the view that the future well-being of\\nhumankind hinges on closer international cooperation\\nand a multipolar world. We should promote democracy\\nin international relations. Multipolarization does not\\nmean back-pedalling into the age of spheres of\\ninfluence or a replay of the now long-gone rivalry of\\nmajor Powers. It simply means bringing about a new\\nregime of international relations under which all\\ncountries — big or small, rich or poor, strong or\\nweak — are treated as equals, and under which no\\ncountry has the right to impose its will on others.\\nWe should cultivate a new security concept based\\non the principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit,\\nequality and cooperation. Security should be\\nmaintained through cooperation, and disputes should\\nbe resolved peacefully through dialogue. The frequent\\nuse of force and the threat of its use should be avoided.\\nThe practice of building one’s own security at the\\nexpense of others should be rejected.\\nWe should support diversity in the process of\\ndevelopment. Our world is a place of many colours and\\nstyles. A single musical note cannot make a melody,\\nnor does a phonetic alphabet make a language. Human\\nwisdom has produced so many civilizations, allowing\\nus to follow different paths of development and a\\nvariety of values. It is through the exchanges,\\nemulations and integrations of diverse cultures that\\nhuman reason and wisdom shine brilliantly.\\nWe should dedicate ourselves to the\\nempowerment of developing countries in their large\\nnumbers. The developing countries, which make up\\nthree quarters of the world’s population, should\\nbecome a key pillar of a multipolar world. Without\\ntheir extensive participation on an equal footing, there\\nwill be no democracy in international relations or a fair\\nand rational world order. Without their economic\\nrevitalization, there can be no common development of\\nall humankind to speak of.\\nWe should step up multilateral cooperation.\\nMultilateral cooperation in various forms should\\nbecome the principal vehicle in the handling of\\ninternational affairs. Countries should join hands in\\ntaking on global challenges through globalized\\ncooperation.\\nIn a multipolar world, countries should respect\\nand consult with one another politically, strive for\\ncommon development by helping one another\\neconomically, prosper together by drawing on one\\n29\\n\\nanother’s cultural strengths and jointly maintain\\nsecurity through mutual trust, thus working hand in\\nhand to realize the peace and prosperity of humankind.\\nMore than half a century ago, our forefathers\\ngathered to give birth to the United Nations. The past\\n58 years have seen the Organization’s notable\\naccomplishments in preserving peace in regions and\\naround the world and in promoting human development\\nand progress. The spirit of the United Nations\\nCharter — characterized by such words as “to live\\ntogether in peace with one another as good neighbours”\\nand “to promote social progress and better standards of\\nlife in large freedom” — has been widely accepted in\\nthe international community.\\nThe United Nations has become the most\\nuniversal, most representative and most authoritative\\ninternational organization in the world today. This is\\nwhat history affirms and what reality mandates.\\nChina maintains that in the current situation the\\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\\nshould be adhered to and earnestly abided by with a\\nview to realizing democracy, the rule of law in\\ninternational relations and the mutually advantageous\\ncoexistence of the countries of the world.\\nIn handling affairs affecting regional or\\ninternational peace, all Member States are obliged to\\nmaintain the leading role and authority of the United\\nNations and its Security Council. China is in favour of\\nan important role for the United Nations in Iraq’s post-\\nwar arrangements and reconstruction and supports the\\nrestoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people at an early\\ndate.\\nChina also supports the United Nations carrying\\nout the necessary reforms to enhance its role and\\neffectiveness in the light of changing circumstances.\\nThe United Nations is a microcosm of our world.\\nThe world’s hope rests on a strong United Nations. In\\norder to build a better future for humankind, it is\\nincumbent upon us first to turn the United Nations into\\na forum for cooperation instead of an arena of\\nrecrimination. No country is entirely populated by\\nsaints and therefore no country should have the right to\\nthrow the stones of prejudice.\\nTo that end, we should forsake all the old\\nbaggage of arrogance, estrangement and narrow-\\nmindedness and let harmony, understanding and\\ntolerance ring out loudly as the undiminished themes of\\nthis great Hall. The ocean is made great by all the\\nrivers it takes in. Let that be the motto of all Member\\nStates.\\nDevelopment is the foundation for world peace\\nand human progress. We stand for stronger\\ninternational cooperation and the achievement of\\ncommon development.\\nThe current state of affairs — in which the gap\\nbetween the North and the South has been widening\\nwithout pause, with some countries of the South\\nlanguishing in dire poverty — must be changed without\\nfurther delay. The key lies in establishing a fair and\\nequitable new world economic order in response to the\\nrequirements of economic globalization.\\nAn open and fair multilateral trading regime\\nshould be established and improved. The principles of\\nmutual understanding and mutual accommodation\\nshould be followed to bring about due progress in\\nmultilateral trade talks. Close attention should be given\\nto reforming and improving the international financial\\nsystem, setting up a financial early-warning mechanism\\nand enhancing the capacity of countries to prevent and\\ndeal with financial crises.\\nStronger South-South cooperation and North-\\nSouth exchanges should be promoted. The developing\\ncountries should step up their cooperation and\\ncoordination and gradually change their\\ndisadvantageous position in the economic globalization\\nprocess. This coming December, the second ministerial\\nconference of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum\\nwill be held in Addis Ababa, where the two sides will\\nwork together to deepen their equality-based and\\nmutually beneficial cooperation and open up a new\\nhorizon in South-South cooperation.\\nThe developed countries should also shoulder\\ntheir duties and responsibilities by giving greater\\nsupport to the developing countries in the areas of\\nmarket access, funding, technology transfer, debt relief\\nand trade terms.\\nAll human communities make an organic whole\\nwhen it comes to development. When hundreds of\\nmillions of fellow human beings are suffering from\\ncold and hunger, the rich countries should not nor\\ncannot enjoy their riches by themselves for long. The\\nstriking contrast in wealth is eroding the very dignity\\nthat all human beings share. Upon the monstrous gap\\n30\\n\\nbetween the North and South cannot stand the great\\nedifice of future prosperity.\\nWhile addressing the development issue, it is\\nnecessary to highlight the need for a harmonious\\ndevelopment of the economy and society.\\nAt present, humankind’s further development is\\nbeing increasingly hampered by excessive population\\ngrowth, environmental degradation, energy depletion,\\nthe decline and demise of indigenous cultures, and\\nother constraints. Sustainable development can be truly\\nrealized only when there is harmony, mutual\\ncomplementarity and mutual promotion between the\\neconomy and society, and between their development\\nand nature.\\nIn the first half of the year, SARS struck a\\nnumber of regions and countries, which testifies yet\\nagain to the crucial importance of public health in the\\ncontext of development. While countries should\\nstrengthen their public health systems, the world in\\ngeneral should enhance its capacity to deal with major\\ndiseases and disasters through an improved globalized\\ncontingency response mechanism.\\nThe Chinese Government supports the proposal\\nmade by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\\ncertain countries at the fifty-sixth World Health\\nAssembly for the establishment of a global fund\\nagainst SARS and is ready to contribute to it. We call\\non all countries to support the United Nations in its\\nrelevant activities, including incorporating public\\nhealth into United Nations development programmes\\nand other action plans and promoting regional and\\ninternational cooperation in this regard.\\nLast fall, the Communist Party of China convened\\nits 16th National Congress, which called for the\\nbuilding, during the first two decades of the twenty-\\nfirst century, of a society that is well off in all respects.\\nThis past spring, a new Chinese Central Government\\nwas elected at the 10th National People’s Congress —\\nthus a smooth leadership transition was realized.\\nIn the first half of the year, the people of China\\nput up a heroic fight against SARS and won a\\nresounding victory. Many friendly countries and\\npersonalities in the world, together with the World\\nHealth Organization and other United Nations\\nagencies, have rendered us valuable support and\\nassistance, for which I wish to express our heartfelt\\ngratitude.\\nChina has kept its economic growth in high gear.\\nThe first two quarters saw the nation’s gross domestic\\nproduct grow by 8.2 per cent over the corresponding\\nperiod of last year, and foreign trade grow by 39 per\\ncent. China’s economic efficiency has improved\\nmarkedly, and its reforms on all fronts are progressing\\nin an orderly way.\\nNeedless to say, China is a developing country. It\\nstill has a long way to go before all its citizens can live\\na comfortable, even affluent life. Development,\\ntherefore, remains China’s top priority.\\nChina’s development requires a peaceful\\ninternational and surrounding environment. We will\\ncontinue to pursue an independent foreign policy of\\npeace and will seek to play a constructive role in\\nregional and international affairs.\\nChina will continue to push for friendship and\\ngood-neighbourliness in the interest of peace and\\ntranquillity in the region. Based on our support for a\\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula on which peace and\\nstability should be maintained, we initiated and\\nsponsored the three-party Beijing talks and the first\\nround of six-party talks. China remains committed to\\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\\npeacefully through dialogue and the building of a\\nlasting peace there.\\nTo develop, China needs the world, and a\\nprosperous world also needs China. The market and\\ncooperation potential unleashed by a rapidly\\ndeveloping China could bring fresh and immeasurable\\nopportunities to the region and to the world at large.\\nWe desire peace, stability and development. We\\naspire to equality, mutual benefit and a win-win result\\nfor all. Conforming to the tide of history, China has\\nopted for the path of peaceful development, linking its\\nrejuvenation with that of the region, with the interests\\nof the majority of countries, and with the lofty cause of\\npeace and development for humanity. We hereby\\npledge our continued and ever-greater contribution to\\nworld prosperity and progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I am confident that under your\\npresidency fruitful results will be achieved. I also wish\\nto pay a cordial tribute to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte,\\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\\nsession, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\\nThe recent appalling terror in Beslan, Russia,\\ncaused massive casualties, including many children.\\nOn behalf of the Chinese Government, I strongly\\ncondemn, once again, that inhuman act of terrorist\\nviolence and extend our deep condolences to the\\nfamilies of the victims.\\nPeace and development remain the dominant\\nthemes in today’s world. Multipolarization and\\neconomic globalization are moving forward in twists\\nand turns. Science and technology are advancing at a\\ndizzying speed. Forces that make for peace and factors\\nthat lead to war are both on the rise. Human society is\\nmoving in a bright, progressive and positive direction.\\nHowever, the light of peace has not fallen on\\nevery corner of the globe, nor has development reached\\nevery inch of the Earth. Threats to security, both\\ntraditional and non-traditional, are intertwined. The\\ndark cloud of war remains menacing. Hot spots keep\\nspringing up. Terrorist activities are raging, and cross-\\nborder problems such as the proliferation of weapons\\nof mass destruction, drug trafficking, transnational\\ncrime and illegal immigration are erupting one after\\nanother. Factors of uncertainty, instability and\\nunpredictability are increasing.\\nIn the course of economic globalization, the gap\\nbetween the North and the South is widening.\\nDeveloping countries are confronting new difficulties\\nand challenges as a growing number of them are\\nfurther marginalized. Today, half the global population\\nlives on less than $2 a day, and of those, 1.2 billion live\\non less than $1 a day. Much remains to be done to\\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals.\\nPeace, development and cooperation are the\\nprerequisites for our times. People all over the world\\nare raising their voice in favour of peace, development\\nand cooperation and against war, poverty and\\nconfrontation. Peace is the precondition for human\\ndevelopment and prosperity. Without a peaceful and\\nstable international environment, development is out of\\nthe question for any country. A chaotic world benefits\\nno one. Having experienced the scourge of two world\\nwars, mankind would not tolerate any more war or\\nbloodshed. Thus it is the fervent aspiration of all\\npeoples to live and achieve development in a secure\\nand stable environment.\\nIn tackling security issues, it is imperative to\\nfoster a new security concept of mutual trust, mutual\\nbenefit, equality and cooperation. This new concept\\ncalls for nations to transcend their differences in\\nideology and social systems, respect one another’s\\nsecurity interests, promote greater democracy in\\ninternational relations and seek peaceful solutions to\\ndisputes through dialogue.\\nTerrorism is the common enemy of the whole\\nworld. China stands firmly opposed to terrorism in all\\nforms and manifestations. To prevent and fight\\nterrorism, we must intensify international cooperation\\nand address both the causes and symptoms of the\\nthreat. Only when the root causes of terrorism are\\neradicated can peoples live in peace and tranquillity\\nagain.\\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nposes a threat to world peace and security. Non-\\nproliferation efforts therefore require the participation\\nof all members of the international community.\\nLikewise, it is important to discard unilateralism and\\ndouble standards and to give full credit and full latitude\\nto the role of the United Nations.\\nChina takes an active part in multilateral non-\\nproliferation efforts and firmly defends the\\ninternational regime of arms control, disarmament and\\nnon-proliferation treaties. China believes that\\nmultilateral arms control, disarmament and non-\\nproliferation processes can be steadily promoted in\\norder to further improve the international non-\\nproliferation regime.\\nThere is still a long way to go before peace and\\nreconstruction can be realized in Iraq. We support an\\nimportant role for the United Nations in Iraq’s political\\nprocess, helping that country achieve the smooth\\nholding of elections.\\n10\\n\\nWe appeal to Palestine and Israel to resume\\ndialogue as soon as possible and to start implementing\\nthe Middle East road map faithfully. As always, China\\nwill work to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean\\nPeninsula through dialogue and talks, in the interest of\\npeace and stability on the Peninsula.\\nDevelopment is the foundation for human\\nprogress. Lasting peace and stability throughout the\\nworld depends on coordinated, balanced and universal\\ndevelopment. Development is of overriding\\nimportance. Living in peace, abundance and harmony\\nbetween nations has been the dream of many\\ngenerations. Coordinated, balanced and sustainable\\ndevelopment serves the fundamental interests of all\\npeoples and works for their well-being.\\nIn order to promote economic growth worldwide,\\nit is necessary for the international community to take\\neffective measures to put in place an open and fair\\nmultilateral trading regime and gradually improve it. It\\nis also important to reform and improve the\\ninternational financial system.\\nThe developed countries must honour their\\ncommitments to debt reduction, technology transfer\\nand market access through concrete actions in order to\\nenable developing countries to really benefit from\\nglobalization. The developing countries, for their part,\\nneed to work together to attain development and take\\npart in a wide range of international efforts. They\\nshould also deepen South-South cooperation.\\nWe, the members of the international community,\\nshould join hands in working for a just and equitable\\nnew international economic order that meets the needs\\nof the growing economic globalization and serves the\\ncommon interests of all countries.\\nThe Millennium Development Goals are our\\nsolemn, collective pledge. The United Nations should\\nfurther mobilize resources, strengthen coordination and\\nincrease its input to development activities in order to\\nhelp Member States achieve these important goals as\\nscheduled.\\nCooperation is an effective way of dealing with\\nthe collective challenges facing humankind. To\\nstrengthen international cooperation, we must\\nchampion multilateralism. The United Nations is the\\ncentre of the international multilateral system and the\\nkey platform for making multilateralism work. It is the\\nwidespread desire of the international community to\\nadhere to the purposes and principles of the United\\nNations Charter, take more collective actions,\\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations and safeguard\\nits authority.\\nThe threats and challenges we face make it\\nimperative to strengthen, rather than weaken, the role\\nof the United Nations. A stronger United Nations is\\nindispensable for maintaining global peace and\\nstability and promoting the common development of\\nhumankind. All Member States should honour their\\ncommitments to the Charter of the United Nations and\\nfulfil their international responsibilities and\\nobligations.\\nThe world is eagerly looking forward to a\\ndynamic and action-oriented United Nations. China\\nsupports necessary and rational reforms of the\\nOrganization. Such reforms should aim at enhancing\\nthe leading role of the United Nations in international\\naffairs, reinforcing its capacity to tackle new threats\\nand challenges, and ensuring that better reflects the\\naspirations and needs of the vast majority of\\ndeveloping countries.\\nChina is in favour of expanding the Security\\nCouncil and of giving priority to greater representation\\nof the developing countries. China also supports the\\nwork of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\\nand Change, and it is looking forward to the Panel’s\\nreport by the end of this year, so that it can be reviewed\\nby Member States.\\nChina is a staunch force working for world peace,\\ncommon development and international cooperation.\\nAfter over half a century of strenuous efforts and more\\nthan two decades of reform and opening up, China has\\nnow entered a new stage of development aimed at\\nbuilding a moderately prosperous society all-round.\\nHowever, China is still a developing country, and a\\nlarge population and inadequate economic\\ndevelopment remain its basic national conditions. It\\nhas a long way to go before achieving its development\\ngoals.\\nThe Chinese Government will always place\\ndevelopment at the top of its agenda. The fact that\\nChina — a large, developing country with 1.3 billion\\npeople — runs its own affairs well is in itself a major\\ncontribution to peace and to the development of\\nhumanity.\\n11\\n\\nChina desires peace, development and\\ncooperation, and strives to win peace and development\\nthrough cooperation. It is working to promote\\ndemocracy in international relations, diversity in its\\nmodes of development and richness in the world’s\\ncivilizations. It advocates a new security concept and\\nfacilitates the establishment of a fair and equitable new\\ninternational order.\\nChina will pursue with determination an\\nindependent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the five\\nprinciples for Peaceful Coexistence, and engage in\\nmutually beneficial and friendly cooperation with other\\ncountries on an equal footing.\\nChina will unswervingly safeguard its\\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, brook no\\ninterference in its internal affairs by foreign forces and,\\nat the same time, respect other countries’ sovereignty\\nand territorial integrity.\\nChina remains committed to the common\\ninterests of humankind. China’s national interests, in\\nthe final analysis, are consistent with the common\\ninterests of all humankind. In handling State-to-State\\nrelations, China will safeguard its own interests while\\ntaking into account the interests of other countries.\\nChina will adhere to the policy of opening up, and\\ndevelop economic relations and trade with all other\\nnations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\\nChina’s development stands in the way of no one,\\nnor does it pose any threat to others. China is following\\nthe path of peaceful development, seeking an\\ninternational environment of peace and stability for its\\nown development and promoting world peace and\\nprogress through its own prosperity.\\nChina is working steadily to develop its relations\\nwith the world’s major countries. It will stay\\ncommitted to the policy of building friendship and\\npartnership with its neighbours and combine stronger\\nbilateral friendships with enhanced regional\\ncooperation. It will strengthen solidarity and\\ncooperation with other developing countries and\\nsupport any justified demands or legitimate\\npropositions on their part in international affairs. It will\\nplay a constructive role in the political, economic,\\nsocial, disarmament, arms control and other\\nmultilateral fields; safeguard the purposes and\\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the\\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\\nrelations; and support any consensus that serves the\\ncommon interests of all countries.\\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\\nSafeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial\\nintegrity and realizing complete national reunification\\nat an early date is the common will and firm resolve of\\nthe 1.3 billion Chinese people. Pursuing the policy of\\n“peaceful reunification and one country, two systems”,\\nthe Chinese Government is ready to work tirelessly\\ntowards a peaceful reunification with the utmost\\nsincerity. We, more than anyone else, want to see a\\npeaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. But we\\nwill never tolerate Taiwan independence, nor will we\\nallow anyone to separate Taiwan from the rest of China\\nin any way.\\nWe hope that the international community will\\nfully recognize the complex and sensitive nature of the\\ncurrent situation across the Taiwan Strait and the\\nserious threat posed by the separatist activities of the\\nTaiwan authorities to the stability of the Taiwan Strait\\nand the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. We expect the\\nAssembly to continue supporting the Chinese\\nGovernment’s efforts for peaceful reunification and to\\njoin us in containing pro-independence activities, in the\\ninterest of stability in the Strait and of world peace.\\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\\nFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As the basic\\nguidelines for State-to-State relations, the Five\\nPrinciples have withstood the test of half a century and\\nremain an irrefutable truth. The Five Principles, which\\ninclude peace, development and cooperation, are\\nconsistent with the purposes and principles of the\\nCharter of the United Nations.

I am confident that, under your \\nguidance, this session will achieve full success. I also \\nwish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of the \\nlast session, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I \\nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate \\nthe Republic of Montenegro on becoming a Member of \\nthe United Nations. \\n The world is experiencing profound and complex \\nchanges. Peace, development and cooperation have \\nbecome trends of our times and represent the common \\naspirations of all countries and peoples in the world. \\nHowever, the world is not tranquil and the issue of \\ndevelopment remains prominent. There is still a long \\nway to go in the pursuit of durable peace and common \\ndevelopment. Recently, the nuclear issue on the Korean \\nPeninsula, the Iranian nuclear issue and the Lebanese-\\nIsraeli conflict have flared up, adversely affecting \\nregional and global stability and testing the wisdom, \\nunity and patience of the international community. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 22 \\n \\n To maintain peace is the shared mission of the \\nentire international community. Consultations based on \\nequality and peaceful negotiations are the only \\neffective means to resolve disputes. China, as a \\npermanent member of the Security Council and a \\nmember of the international community, will continue \\nto make every effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of \\nhotspot issues. \\n As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean \\nPeninsula, China is committed to maintaining peace \\nand stability on the Peninsula, making it free of nuclear \\nweapons and promoting the six-party talks. During the \\nSecurity Council’s deliberations in July regarding the \\nmissile tests by the Democratic People’s Republic of \\nKorea and the related resolution, China made strenuous \\nefforts to engage the parties concerned, in an effort to \\nmaintain peace on the Peninsula and in North-East Asia \\nand preserve the unity and authority of the Security \\nCouncil and safeguard the progress already made in the \\nsix-party talks. \\n Long-standing antagonism and mistrust between \\nthe parties concerned is the main cause of the current \\ndifficulty. All parties should be patient and pragmatic \\nand act with vision to reduce differences and remove \\nobstacles through dialogue. The six-party talks remain \\nan effective mechanism to enhance understanding and \\ntrust and resolve the Korean nuclear issue. We hope \\nthat the parties involved will be cool-headed and more \\nflexible, expand common ground, meet each other \\nhalfway and work together for the early resumption of \\nthe six-party talks and progressive implementation of \\nthe joint statement. That is the only viable solution to \\nthe Korean nuclear issue. \\n With respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, China \\ncalls for upholding the integrity of the international \\nnuclear non-proliferation regime, and is opposed to the \\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It has worked for a \\npeaceful resolution of the issue in order to promote \\npeace and stability in the Middle East. At the same \\ntime, the legitimate right of countries to the peaceful \\nuse of nuclear energy should be fully respected, \\nprovided they fulfil their relevant international \\nobligations. \\n Diplomatic negotiation represents the best chance \\nto resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and serve the \\ninterests of all parties. China hopes that the parties \\ninvolved will exercise patience and restraint, continue \\nto take a flexible approach and remain committed to \\nthe right course of pursuing a peaceful resolution. \\nChina will continue to play a constructive role in \\nworking for an appropriate settlement of the Iranian \\nnuclear issue. \\n As regards the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, China \\nopposes any move that will undermine peace and \\nstability in the region, and calls for a comprehensive \\ncessation of hostilities. China welcomes Security \\nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and hopes that it will \\nbe strictly observed. China hopes that the parties \\nconcerned will reach an early agreement on a \\nframework of political settlement that is both just and \\ndurable. \\n The question of Palestine is at the core of the \\nMiddle East issue. The peace process should be re-\\nstarted in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the \\nUnited Nations and the principle of land for peace, in \\nthe interest of reaching an early and comprehensive \\nsettlement of the Middle East issue, including the \\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, so that the countries \\ninvolved can live in harmony and the region can enjoy \\ndurable peace. \\n The United Nations has played an instrumental \\nrole in resolving regional flashpoints this year. But the \\nOrganization also faces major challenges. In the new \\ninternational environment, to enhance its role through \\nreform is in the common interest of humankind. The \\nUnited Nations needs to take resolute steps in carrying \\nout reform. The United Nations should develop in a \\nway that promotes the purposes and principles of its \\nCharter, upholds the unity and cooperation of the \\nOrganization and serves the collective interests of its \\nMembers. The reform of the United Nations should be \\ncomprehensive in coverage, and progress should be \\nmade in security, development, human rights and other \\nfields. More should be done to promote development \\nand facilitate the realization of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. The reform of the Organization \\nshould, as far as possible, satisfy the needs of its \\nMember States, particularly those from the developing \\nworld. The reform should be a democratic process and \\nfull consultations should be conducted to reach \\nwidespread consensus. Major controversial issues \\nshould be handled with caution and dealt with through \\nin-depth consultations. \\n China welcomes the progress made in reforming \\nthe United Nations, in particular the progress in \\nimplementing the World Summit Outcome. We will \\n \\n \\n23 06-53317 \\n \\npledge $3 million to the United Nations Peacebuilding \\nFund. We will continue to work with other countries to \\nmake progress in the reform of the United Nations, \\nstrengthen the unity and authority of the Organization \\nand increase its efficiency and capacity to respond to \\nchallenges. \\n As the chief administrator of the United Nations, \\nthe Secretary-General has an important role to play. In \\nthe election of the next Secretary-General, China will \\nfirmly support an Asian candidate. We are convinced \\nthat Asia can produce a competent and well-respected \\nSecretary-General acceptable to all Member States. \\n The scale of assessments for the apportionment of \\nthe expenses of the United Nations involves the \\ninterests of all Member States and constitutes the \\nfinancial foundation of the Organization. All Member \\nStates have an obligation to pay their assessments on \\ntime and in full. The ability to pay is the basic \\nprinciple governing the scale of assessments. It should \\nbe adhered to, as it has proved effective and represents \\nthe general consensus of Member States. Over the \\nyears, China has honoured its financial obligations in \\ngood faith and has made appropriate contributions to \\nthe budget of the United Nations. As China’s economy \\ngrows, we are prepared to increase our contributions to \\nthe Organization’s budget in accordance with the \\nprinciple of ability to pay. We are ready to take part in \\nrelevant discussions in a constructive way, and hope \\nthat a fair and equitable formula will be reached on the \\nbasis of extensive consultations. \\n Without overall development, global peace and \\nprogress cannot be sustained. In addition to developing \\nthe concept of partnership and improving its \\nmodalities, all countries should honour our \\ncommitment to the global partnership for development \\nset out in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \\nConsensus, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation \\nand last year’s World Summit Outcome.  \\n Countries should shoulder the primary \\nresponsibility for their own development and \\nimplement comprehensive development strategies in \\nkeeping with the Millennium Development Goals \\n(MDGs). \\n The international community — and developed \\ncountries in particular — should increase development \\nassistance, promote international trade, technology \\ntransfers and investment, offer more extensive debt \\nrelief, provide more support to developing countries \\nand respect their ownership of national development \\nstrategies. \\n The United Nations should play a bigger role in \\nthe field of development. It should create a fair and \\nequitable framework to assess progress in meeting the \\nMDGs and ensure that the United Nations Foundation \\nand the various United Nations programmes and \\nspecialized agencies provide greater support for \\ncapacity-building programmes in developing countries. \\nIt should enhance coordination between international \\ndevelopment policy and monetary, financial and \\ntrading regimes and create an enabling international \\nenvironment for developing countries. \\n The suspension of the Doha round serves \\nnobody’s interests. Members of the World Trade \\nOrganization should demonstrate political will, \\nspeedily resume the Doha development round and \\nwork towards a comprehensive and balanced outcome. \\n Non-governmental organizations should be \\nencouraged to be more extensively and deeply involved \\nin development cooperation. Their efforts and those of \\nGovernments should complement each other. \\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \\nechoes the calling of our times. Member States have a \\ncommon responsibility to make the Council a dynamic \\nand effective body. The Council should give greater \\nattention to massive and gross violations of human \\nrights caused by armed conflicts and should support \\nthe international community in its efforts to prevent \\nconflicts, restore peace and combat terrorism in all its \\nforms and manifestations. \\n The Council should attach equal importance to \\neconomic, social and cultural rights and encourage the \\ninternational community and United Nations agencies \\nto take effective measures to support countries in their \\nefforts to realize their right to development.  \\n The Council should continue to give special \\nattention to the rights of women, children, persons with \\ndisabilities, migrant workers, ethnic minorities and \\nother vulnerable groups to ensure that they enjoy the \\nsame level of respect as others. \\n The Council should promote dialogue and \\ncooperation on an equal footing between countries of \\ndifferent social systems and levels of development, \\naddress human rights issues properly and reject double \\nstandards and politicization. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 24 \\n \\n For decades, relations between China and African \\ncountries have been characterized by sincerity and \\nmutual support. We have conducted our cooperation on \\nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit, while \\nsafeguarding sovereignty and independence and \\npromoting social and economic development in our \\nrespective countries. All that has served to bring about \\nsignificant benefits for the Chinese and African peoples \\nalike. \\n China and Africa will hold a summit and the third \\nministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa \\nCooperation in Beijing from 3 to 5 November. \\nFocusing on the theme of friendship, peace, \\ncooperation and development, Chinese and African \\nleaders will discuss ways to establish and foster a new \\ntype of strategic partnership featuring political equality \\nand mutual trust, win-win economic cooperation and \\ncultural exchanges. They will also draft a blueprint to \\nenhance China-Africa cooperation. China is committed \\nto peaceful development. Africa, which is home to the \\nlargest number of developing countries, is committed \\nto achieving stability and renewal. Stronger ties \\nbetween China and Africa will contribute to South-\\nSouth cooperation and international peace and \\ndevelopment. \\n The conduct of China’s diplomacy aims to \\nsafeguard world peace and promote common \\ndevelopment. China is committed to developing itself \\nthrough safeguarding and promoting world peace \\nthrough its own development. We are pursuing \\ndevelopment that is peaceful, inclusive, cooperative \\nand harmonious in nature. We will endeavour to \\npromote the fundamental interests of our own people in \\nharmony with the common interests of other peoples \\nand to pursue peace, promote development and resolve \\ndisputes through cooperation. \\n China is dedicated to building a harmonious \\nworld. It hopes to increase mutual respect and \\nunderstanding with other countries and to live in \\nharmony with them. China respects the right of a \\ncountry to choose its own path to development. It \\nsupports equal participation by different countries in \\ninternational affairs and democracy in international \\nrelations. It works to enhance mutual benefits, win-win \\noutcomes and global prosperity through sharing the \\nbenefits of economic globalization and technological \\nprogress. China seeks to promote a diversified world \\nand advance human civilization by furthering dialogue, \\nunderstanding and mutual enrichment between \\ndifferent cultures. China is committed to advancing \\nhuman progress by enhancing dialogue, building \\nmutual trust with other countries and working with \\nthem to address global issues. \\n China will continue to demonstrate to the world \\nthat it is an important force for global peace and \\ndevelopment and that the Chinese people will remain \\ntrustworthy friends and cooperation partners to the \\nworld’s peoples.    \n",
       "27  I  wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \\nsession. I am convinced that under your able \\nleadership, the current session will be a fruitful one. I \\nalso wish to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for \\nher contribution during her presidency of the previous \\nsession. \\n The current international environment is highly \\ncomplex. Mankind is facing both unprecedented \\nopportunities and challenges. There is a growing trend \\ntowards peace, development and cooperation in the \\nworld. But, on the other hand, traditional and non-\\ntraditional security threats are intertwined; hotspot \\nissues are acute; the gap between the North and South \\nis widening; trade protectionism is resurfacing; and \\ndeveloping countries generally remain in a \\ndisadvantaged position. The steady trend towards \\neconomic globalization and towards a multi-polar \\nworld is fostering a new way of thinking about \\ninternational relations. \\n In this Hall two years ago, Chinese President Hu \\nJintao called on mankind to build a harmonious world \\nwith lasting peace and common prosperity in the \\ntwenty-first century (see A/60/PV.5). The core message \\nof his call is that, while recognizing the diversity of the \\nworld, differences of interests and diversity of cultures, \\nwe should harmonize interests, defuse conflicts and \\npromote cooperation for win-win progress in a \\npeaceful and cooperative manner. \\n In its 62-year history, the United Nations has \\nplayed an irreplaceable role in promoting humankind’s \\ncause of peace and development. The current session of \\nthe General Assembly should focus on promoting \\nharmonious coexistence among countries. Resolving \\nhotspot issues and peacefully settling international \\ndisputes through dialogue and cooperation are not only \\nexplicitly called for by the United Nations Charter. \\nThey are also the right way to uphold world peace and \\nstability and achieve mutual benefit and a win-win \\nsituation for all. \\n China remains committed to seeking a peaceful \\nsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula \\nthrough dialogue to uphold peace and stability on the \\npeninsula and throughout North-East Asia. The Six-\\nParty Talks have become an important platform for the \\nparties concerned to maintain dialogue and \\nconsultations on achieving denuclearization on the \\npeninsula, normalizing relations between the countries \\nconcerned and building a new harmonious architecture \\nin North-East Asia. We will continue to play a \\nconstructive role in advancing the process of the Six-\\nParty Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean \\npeninsula. \\n Diplomatic negotiations are the best option for \\nresolving the Iranian nuclear issue peacefully and \\nmeeting the common interests of the international \\ncommunity. China opposes nuclear-weapon \\nproliferation and stands for upholding the international \\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and \\nstability in the Middle East. No non-proliferation effort \\nshould deviate from the goal of upholding international \\npeace and stability. Countries should honour their due \\ninternational obligations, and their right to peaceful use \\nof nuclear energy should be fully respected. China \\nurges the parties concerned to show flexibility and \\nresume negotiations at an early date. China will \\ncontinue to contribute its share to the peaceful \\nsettlement of the Iranian nuclear issue. \\n The Palestine-Israel conflict is at the core of the \\nMiddle East issue. China supports the just cause of the \\nPalestinian and other Arab peoples and the restoration \\nof their lawful national rights, and it sincerely hopes \\nthat Arab countries and Israel will promptly end their \\ndisputes through political negotiations on the basis of \\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of \\nland for peace. China calls on Palestine to strengthen \\nits unity and welcomes the initiative to hold an \\ninternational conference on the Middle East. We hope \\nthat the Iraqi people will continue to work for national \\nreconciliation and restore peace and stability at an \\nearly date, and that this will lead to a comprehensive, \\njust and lasting resolution of the Middle East issue. \\n The trilateral dialogue and consultation among \\nthe United Nations, the African Union and the \\nSudanese Government on an equal footing is an \\neffective mechanism for resolving the Darfur issue. \\nThe international community should work to sustain \\nthe current sound momentum and give full play to the \\nrole of the trilateral mechanism as the main channel. \\nWe should adhere to dual-track strategy, promote \\nbalanced progress in peacekeeping operations and the \\npolitical process and seek a lasting solution to the \\nDarfur issue through making progress in the security, \\npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social areas. \\nChina is committed to a proper settlement of the Darfur \\nissue. It has provided humanitarian assistance to Darfur \\non a number of occasions and will send a military \\nengineering unit to join the peacekeeping operations \\nthere. China will continue to firmly support the peace \\nand national reconciliation process in the Sudan and \\nwill contribute to the resolution of the Darfur issue and \\npeace, stability and development in the Sudan. \\n At its current session, the General Assembly \\nshould promote the peaceful development of all \\ncountries. Poverty is a major source of disputes, and \\nonly development can eliminate poverty. Human \\ndevelopment concerns us all. Obviously, it is \\nimpossible to build common prosperity when there is a \\nhuge chasm between the North and the South. The \\ninternational community should act with a sense of \\nurgency and redouble its efforts to deliver the \\nMillennium Development Goals, narrow the North-\\nSouth gap and, in particular, meet Africa’s special \\ndevelopment needs. Developed countries should \\nincrease assistance, further open their domestic \\nmarkets, transfer more technologies to developing \\ncountries and provide greater debt relief to them. \\n For their part, developing countries, on their part, \\nshould adopt development strategies and policies \\nsuited to their national conditions and boost their \\neconomic development. We should support an open, \\nequitable and fair multilateral trade regime and oppose \\ntrade protectionism. We should work for an early, \\ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \\nRound negotiations and make it a development round. \\nReform of the international economic system should \\nfully reflect changes in the world economy and should \\ngive developing countries more say and greater \\nrepresentation in the international economic system. \\n China gives a high priority to strengthening \\ninternational cooperation on development as it \\ndevelops itself. We seek coordinated and balanced \\nglobal development. While a developing country itself, \\nChina has all along provided assistance to African \\ncountries and other developing countries, according to \\nits ability, and has helped them to improve their \\ncapacity for independent and sustainable development. \\nThat is because we believe that lasting peace and the \\ncommon prosperity of the world is possible only with \\nthe development of developing countries. \\n To help Africa attain stability, security and \\nsustainable development is the common responsibility \\nof the international community. China and African \\ncountries enjoy mutual political respect and equality \\nand economic mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. \\nThey support one another and maintain close \\nconsultation in international affairs. We draw on one \\nanother’s strengths in governance to promote \\ndevelopment. Thanks to our joint efforts, China-Africa \\ncooperation has yielded fruitful results. Such \\ncooperation is well received by the African countries, \\nand it has brought great benefits to both the Chinese \\nand African peoples. China’s cooperation with Africa \\nfacilitates Africa’s cooperation with other countries and \\nis not targeted against any third party. \\n The current session of the General Assembly \\nshould be devoted to promoting harmony between man \\nand nature. Development in the world has both \\nadvanced material progress and caused ecological \\nimbalance and environmental pollution. To protect our \\ncommon homeland is a matter of vital importance for \\nour common future. \\n Climate change is an environmental issue, but \\nultimately it is an issue of development. It has arisen in \\nthe course of development and can be resolved only \\nthrough development. We should uphold the \\nframework of the United Nations Framework \\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \\nand adhere to the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities. Developed countries \\nshould face up to their responsibilities, fulfil their \\ncommitments on emissions reduction in earnest and \\ncontinue to take the lead in emissions reduction after \\n2012. We should strengthen international cooperation \\non energy, resources and the environment, step up \\nefforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving \\ntechnologies, environmental protection technologies \\nand low-carbon energy technologies, and establish \\nreasonable mechanisms for financing and technology \\ntransfer. That will enable developing countries to gain \\naccess to and afford advanced environmental-\\nprotection technologies, enhance capacity to respond to \\nclimate change and effectively address climate change \\nthrough achieving sustainable development. \\n China takes climate change seriously. Though its \\ncurrent per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less \\nthan one third of the average of developed countries, \\nChina, acting in a way that is highly responsible to \\nmankind, has taken many effective measures to tackle \\nclimate change, including adopting a series of laws and \\nregulations and setting the goals of reducing energy \\nintensity and increasing forest cover. The Chinese \\nGovernment has set the following targets: to reduce \\nenergy intensity and total discharge of major pollutants \\nby about 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively and \\nto increase the forest cover rate to 20 per cent for the \\nperiod between the end of 2005 and 2010. Under its \\nNational Climate Change Programme, China will take \\nan active part in international cooperation in climate \\nchange and contribute its share to protecting the global \\nclimate. \\n Advancing United Nations reform and enabling \\nthe Organization to play a more important role in \\nmaintaining world peace, promoting common \\ndevelopment and strengthening cooperation among \\ncountries is crucial to building a harmonious world. \\nChina supports the reform of the United Nations. The \\nreform decisions made at the high-level meeting \\nmarking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations \\nheld in 2005 should be implemented in a \\ncomprehensive and balanced manner. Priority should \\nbe given to reform in the area of development, and the \\nUnited Nations should increase its input in that area. \\nThe Human Rights Council should build on the \\noutcome of reform in its previous phase and become a \\nplatform for dialogue and cooperation rather than an \\narena for political confrontation. Security Council \\nreform should give priority to increasing the \\nrepresentation of developing countries and give small \\nand medium-sized countries more opportunities to \\nparticipate in decision-making. Reform proposals \\nshould be based on the widest possible consensus. \\nChina is ready to work with all other parties to turn \\nreform into a process of strengthening consultation and \\ndialogue and promoting solidarity and cooperation \\namong all United Nations Member States. \\n China is committed to building a society of \\ndemocracy, the rule of law, equity and justice, integrity \\nand amity, vitality, stability and order, where people \\nlive in harmony with nature. To achieve that goal, \\nChina is fully implementing the outcomes of scientific \\nthinking on development. We are working to boost \\nsocial productivity and ensure people’s rights in the \\npolitical, economic, cultural, social and other fields. By \\nstriving to build a harmonious society and by \\nimproving the material and cultural life of one fifth of \\nthe world’s population, China is making a true \\ncontribution to the building of a harmonious world. \\n China has always pursued its own development as \\na part of the global effort to promote the common \\nprogress of mankind. In international affairs, we are \\ncommitted to the following goals: promoting \\nparticipation in international affairs by all countries on \\nan equal footing and democracy in international \\nrelations; enabling all countries to share the benefits of \\neconomic globalization and progress in science and \\ntechnology for a win-win outcome; promoting \\nexchanges and understanding among civilizations and \\ndiversity in the world; enhancing dialogue and trust \\namong countries; and jointly tackling global issues. \\nChina unswervingly pursues a path of peaceful \\ndevelopment and will continue to make further \\ncontributions to humankind’s cause of peace and \\ndevelopment. \\n Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. \\nWe will not permit any challenge to the one-China \\nprinciple and General Assembly resolution 2758 \\n(XXVI). For 15 years running, since 1993, the General \\nAssembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related \\nissues in the agenda of the General Assembly session. \\nThis fully demonstrates that any move that runs \\ncounter to the purposes and principles of the United \\nNations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General \\nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any \\nsupport from the United Nations Member States and is \\ndoomed to failure. We hope that the countries \\nconcerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated \\nby the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong \\nmoves of this kind. \\nThe Taiwan authorities are now obstinately \\nclinging to the separatist course of “Taiwan \\nindependence” and are trying by all means to secure a \\nreferendum on applying for membership of the United \\nNations under the name Taiwan. This is another \\ndangerous step towards “de jure Taiwan independence” \\ntaken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked, \\nthis move will gravely endanger peace and stability \\nacross the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region. \\nThe Chinese Government has always made every effort \\nto promote with all sincerity peaceful development of \\ncross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful \\nreunification. However, we will never allow anyone to \\nseparate Taiwan from China in name or in any other \\nway. We hope that the international community will \\ncontinue to support China’s cause of peaceful \\nreunification, support the Chinese people in opposing \\nand repulsing separatist activities for “Taiwan \\nindependence” and work with us to maintain peace and \\nstability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-\\nPacific region. \\n The Olympic Games, which represent humanity’s \\naspiration for peace, development, cooperation and \\nfriendship, will for the first time be held in China, a \\ncountry both ancient and youthful, starting on 8 August \\n2008. One World, One Dream   this is the theme of \\nthe Beijing Olympic Games. The 1.3 billion people in \\nChina, together with the rest of the world, are eagerly \\nlooking forward to the opening of the Games. The \\n2008 Olympic Games are a great event for both the \\nChinese people and the other peoples of the world. We \\nare confident that with the efforts made by the Chinese \\npeople and with strong support from the international \\ncommunity, the 2008 Olympic Games will stand out as \\na highly successful event. \\n   \n",

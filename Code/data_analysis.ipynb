       "      <td>Let me begin, Sir,\\nby paying tribute to your predecessor, Jean Ping, for\\nhis extraordinary work — above all on the world\\nsummit, but also throughout his year as President —\\nand by offering my congratulations to you on\\nbeginning your year in office.\\nI should also like to express, on behalf of the\\nEuropean Union and all its member States, our deepest\\nsympathy and solidarity to the people of the United\\n27\\n\\nStates, particularly those in the Gulf states, in their\\nhour of need.\\nIn early July, my first duty in the presidency of\\nthe European Union was to go to Srebrenica to mark\\nthe tenth anniversary of the massacre there, the worst\\nin Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\nMore than 8,000 people, mainly Muslim, were taken\\naway and killed as the international community just\\nstood to one side. To be sure, we had shown the right\\nconvictions in words, but shamefully, we had failed to\\nact. The lesson of that massacre — and of the even\\ngreater horror of Rwanda a year before — was that we\\nall needed better means to turn our collective will into\\ndecisive action. I think that we in the European Union\\nhave learned in the intervening period. Today, the\\nUnion is on the ground as a military, police or civilian\\npresence in Bosnia, in Aceh, in Iraq, in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo and, with the African Union, in\\nDarfur.\\nI also think that the United Nations has learned\\nthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit this\\nweek, we agreed on the further steps that we need to\\ntake for the Organization to be even more effective. Of\\nall that was agreed at the summit, I believe it will be\\nthe agreement on our “responsibility to protect” that\\nwill be seen in the future as having the greatest\\nsignificance of all. If we follow through on the\\nresponsibility to protect, then never again will\\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\\nhumanity be allowed to take place under our noses\\nwith nothing done.\\nThe responsibility to protect is, of course, a\\nreflection of our common morality. But it is also a\\nrecognition that the world in which we now live is too\\nsmall for us to be unaffected by, or indifferent to, the\\ninnocent victims of murder and oppression. This\\nshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it has\\nbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell, a generation\\nof ideological certainties was swept away. People could\\nsuddenly see partners where before they had only\\nglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrier\\nwas noisily being breached, a revolution in information\\ntechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distance\\nand time. Continents and cultures are now cabled\\ntogether and bound by trade and services in a way that\\nwas unimaginable even a decade ago.\\nIn this new world, we can no longer safely\\ntolerate the general threat that can come from a\\nparticular human tragedy, wherever it takes place. To a\\ngreater extent than ever before, we share the same\\nworld: the same threats and responsibilities, the same\\nopportunities and interests. And precisely because the\\nboundaries of our world have contracted, the\\nhorizons — the ambitions — of many people around\\nthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time in\\nour history, mankind has the ability to realize the\\npotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and in\\nevery region through an open exchange of goods,\\ninvestment, technology and, above all, ideas.\\nNot least in all of this, it is the rise of India and\\nof China that is reordering the world economy.\\nHundreds of millions there and elsewhere have been\\nlifted out of poverty. A new global market has been\\ncreated that ignores the divide — which seemed so\\nfundamental for so many decades — between East and\\nWest.\\nCurrently, not everyone has the chance to share in\\nall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remains\\nblighted by poverty, disease and conflict. The\\nEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable to\\nachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief, trade\\nreform and development aid are all vital, but none of\\nthem can work alone. Fundamental to making poverty\\nhistory are the Governments of the developing world\\nthemselves. And where Governments fail, their own\\npeoples are the victims, as United Nations Special\\nEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka’s damning assessment of the\\nsituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.\\nSub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet to\\nachieve its potential. The American author Thomas\\nFriedman, in his recent book The World Is Flat,\\nhighlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arab\\npeoples whose forebears devised algebra and the\\nalgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based,\\nbut those peoples are now right at the rear of today’s\\ntechnological revolution, with, for example, fewer than\\n2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.\\nThree United Nations Development Programme Arab\\nHuman Development Reports have now set out clearly\\nhow limited economic prospects and stunted political\\nfreedoms have led young and talented people towards\\nalienation and disillusionment.\\nThe answer, however, does not lie in easy\\nstereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is only\\nthe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us to\\nbelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally\\n28\\n\\ndifferent. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust and\\ndespair, and we reject it utterly. Indonesia and\\nTurkey — to name just two — are both striking\\nexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslim\\npopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.\\nWe in the European Union have seen the vibrant\\nMuslim communities in our own countries, and from\\nthat experience have seen how Islamic and Western\\ncultures can be partners in a global society.\\nEveryone knows that the Arab peoples want\\nprosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much\\nas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that the\\nArab world has the lowest scores in regional\\nmeasurements of democratic practices, civil freedoms\\nand good governance is not some cultural inevitability,\\nbut a temporary failure of human will. In that regard,\\nthe international community has a clear responsibility\\nto encourage regionally led political, social and\\neconomic reform. The European Union strongly\\nsupports such reform and will continue to do so.\\nEqually, it has been our active foreign policy that has\\nplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran, especially on\\nthe nuclear dossier.\\nWith our High Representative Javier Solana and\\nmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues,\\nwe have made detailed proposals for the relationship\\nbetween the European Union and Iran to be based on\\ncooperation and respect for international norms and\\ntreaties.\\nOur proposals envisage a high-level, long-term\\npolitical and security framework between the European\\nUnion and Iran, in which we would work together in\\npolitical, economic, scientific and technological areas,\\nincluding the civil nuclear field, in return for Iran\\nproviding guarantees about its intentions and\\ncapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So, we will\\nlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon’s\\nspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic of\\nIran, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\\nOn Iraq, the European Union now has a\\ncomprehensive programme of engagement and has put\\nbehind it divisions over the military action two and a\\nhalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of a\\npeaceful, prosperous, democratic and stable nation.\\nWe are also giving very active support to the\\nQuartet’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace\\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, with two States\\nliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon’s\\nbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and\\nwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas’s work to build\\nthe first stage of an effective, viable State of Palestine.\\nIn July, the European Union again suffered the\\nhorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the target\\nwas my country, the United Kingdom: its capital,\\nLondon. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.\\nInternational terrorism requires an international\\nresponse; otherwise, we all pay the price for each\\nother’s vulnerabilities. The ratification of a\\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism is, therefore, at the\\nhighest priority.\\nBut the threat from terrorists and the political\\ninstability they bring is made worse by the easy\\navailability of weapons in what has become an\\nanarchic, unregulated international trade. These same\\nweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia a\\ndecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.\\nWe already have international instruments to regulate\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We in the\\nEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms control\\nregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that the\\ntime has now come for this Organization to embrace\\nthe idea of an international arms trade treaty, which\\nwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.\\nIt was in the killing fields of Europe, in two\\nsuccessive wars, that the twin ideas of the United\\nNations and of the European Union became imperative.\\nToday, the European Union’s commitment to the\\nUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.\\nAnd it is reflected in what we give in voluntary\\ndonations and to the regular budget and peacekeeping\\noperations.\\nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations\\nremains today what it was at its foundation: to remove\\nthe scourge of war, to reaffirm the worth of the human\\nperson and to promote social progress and better\\nstandards of life. In this changed and changing world,\\nit is the responsibility of us all to ensure that this\\nOrganization has the powers and the resources to\\nachieve all these aims.</td>\n",

       "      <td>﻿I begin by paying a tribute to Dr.\\nAkila Al-Hashimi, a senior member of the Iraqi\\nGoverning Council, who died earlier today.\\nI had the privilege of meeting Dr. Al-Hashimi\\nearlier this year in London and later in Baghdad, and I\\nwas struck by her courage and her dedication to the\\nIraqi people. Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by those\\nwho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic,\\nprosperous future they so richly deserve. The best\\nservice that we can render her memory is to defeat the\\nterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful,\\nfree Iraq prevails.\\nOf course, we owe this service to all those who\\nhave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieira\\nde Mello and the United Nations personnel who were\\nkilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 August\\nwere committed to bringing the ideals of the United\\nNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimate\\nsacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss, but\\nwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqi\\npeople rebuild their country on the principles of justice\\nand security.\\nWhat, I think, makes Iraq so important was the\\nway in which it tested the role and purpose of this\\ninstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughout\\nthat period, the international community remained in\\nagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a\\nChapter VII threat to international peace and security\\nby its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will of\\nthe United Nations. Yet, earlier this year, sadly, we\\ndivided on when and what action was necessary to deal\\nwith the Iraqi threat.\\nOf course, I acknowledge the controversy over\\nthe military action which the United Kingdom, the\\nUnited States and others took and the heavy\\nresponsibilities we now bear, but I firmly believe that\\nthe decisions we took were the right ones. The\\nauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Having\\ngiven Saddam Hussein’s regime a final opportunity to\\ncomply with the United Nations, what would have\\nhappened if we had simply turned away? Would the\\nworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a better\\nplace today? Would the United Nations be a stronger\\ninstitution today? The answer to each of those\\nquestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have been\\nemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator would\\nhave been encouraged to follow his example; and the\\nauthority of this United Nations would have been\\ngravely weakened.\\nYet, whatever the arguments of the spring, we\\nhave now to come together again for a common\\npurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in its\\nthree resolutions 1472 (2003), 1483 (2003) and 1500\\n(2003), we have a shared interest in helping Iraqi\\ncitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which they\\nhave been denied so long and for which this institution\\nwas founded. Yes, the security situation does present\\nformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedom\\nare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They have\\ninflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people, coalition\\nsoldiers and international aid workers, but ultimately\\nthey will fail.\\nAnd let us also not lose sight of what has been\\nachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein’s\\nreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture and\\noppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of\\n31\\n \\nlives is at an end. Instead, we have the beginnings of a\\nrepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;\\nnew ministries providing daily services to the people; a\\nfree press; the freedom for members of all religious\\ncommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals and\\nschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets and\\nhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.\\nWe shall stay in Iraq as long, but only as long, as\\nit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and to\\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as we\\ncan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we can\\nagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthen\\nthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing this\\ntransition, we should be guided by three central\\nprinciples: first, the transfer of powers must reflect\\nrealities on the ground in Iraq, particularly the need to\\nensure security; secondly, the Iraqi institutions must be\\nsufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;\\nand thirdly, the exercise of executive powers and\\nresponsibilities must be based on good governance,\\ninvolving representative Iraqi authorities and coherent\\nconstitutional arrangements. In other words, the timetable\\nshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and their\\ncapacity progressively to assume democratic control,\\nrather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.\\nIraq is, sadly, not the only territory in the Middle\\nEast where the international community faces great\\nchallenges. Three months ago, we all had high hopes\\nabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations,\\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and the\\nUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It is\\ntragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 August\\nby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem, which came only\\na few hours after the terrorist atrocity against the\\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, but the international\\ncommunity has to stay united on both the means and\\nthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternatives\\nto the road map and there can be no alternatives to the\\noutcome the entire world wishes to see — two States,\\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and\\nsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to the\\nthousands who have died on both sides since the\\nbeginning of this appalling conflict.\\nThe breadth of the issues being tackled by the\\nUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates the\\ncontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-\\nTerrorism Committee has given the United Nations a\\nfocus for its work following  September two years\\nago, but we must now build upon that work, giving the\\nCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce the\\ncapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcome\\nterrorism.\\nWe also know that proliferation is one of the\\ngreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Much\\ngood work on proliferation is being done by United\\nNations agencies, particularly the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency, but it is extraordinary that the Security\\nCouncil itself has not addressed the issue of\\nproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement, it is\\ntime that it did.\\nProblems of internal conflict, on the other hand,\\nare regularly on the Security Council’s agenda. The\\nUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experience\\nin this area and has achieved great things in countries\\nas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone, but nation-\\nbuilding is a collaborative effort, requiring the\\nresources and commitment of Member States if the\\nUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. We\\ntherefore need new mechanisms to help prevent\\nconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.\\nWe must also make a real success of the\\nMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome the\\nsetback of Cancún and secure a positive outcome to the\\nDoha Round.\\nThese and other shared problems require\\ncollective responses, as our Secretary-General so\\neloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key to\\nthis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remains\\nan effective global forum capable of delivering results.\\nThe Secretary-General posed some difficult questions\\ntwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek the\\nadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals on\\nreform. I welcome, too, his parallel commitment to\\nmodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.\\nFor our part, the United Kingdom is committed to\\nmaking the Security Council more representative. The\\nissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger and\\nmore representative Council, however, will not of itself\\nmake it easier to make the tough choices which it has\\nto face so often. The most important ingredient is the\\npolitical will and determination of the members of the\\nCouncil to take effective action.\\nThe most important part of the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s speech on Tuesday was about the choices\\nnow confronting the United Nations. He was right\\nabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.\\n32\\n \\nDown one route lies a world in which the United\\nNations strengthens its role as the collective instrument\\nfor protecting our peace and security; down the other\\nroute lies a world in which collective action becomes a\\nsynonym for “inaction”. We must not take this second\\nroute. The Secretary-General’s speech was a challenge\\nto all of us. We all share a world in which international\\nterrorists strike down the innocent, regardless of faith\\nor nationality, and we are all less secure when weapons\\nof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do not\\nhave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism, while\\nproposing no multilateral means of confronting and\\ndealing with these threats.\\nThe British Government is profoundly\\ncommitted, as it always has been, to the ideals of the\\nUnited Nations. To us, the importance of this\\nOrganization has always been its ability to put those\\nhigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedly\\nwith the Secretary-General and the international\\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations retains\\nand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr. President, I\\noffer my congratulations and those of my country on\\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\\nits fifty-ninth session.\\nEighteen months ago, the United Nations faced\\ndivisions more serious than any since the Cuban\\nmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether\\nthe strength and unity which we had built up since the\\nend of the cold war could survive.\\nThen last year we watched, as Secretary-General\\nKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.\\nIn the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided\\nto follow our Secretary-Generalís directions. This\\nOrganization has not been plunged, as some predicted,\\ninto paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if\\nunspoken determination to make the United Nations\\nwork, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central\\ntask: to secure peace around the world.\\nOver the last 12 months we have dealt with new\\ncrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we\\nhave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government\\nand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great\\nLakes; mobilized international support for the new\\nIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important\\nsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they should\\nin the media ó Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste,\\nBougainville and Western Sahara.\\nWe have shown in those actions the unity of\\npurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our\\nhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.\\nAnd the search for consensus has not been confined to\\nthe Security Council.\\nI am proud that just a few months after the\\ndifficult times of early last year, France, Germany and\\nthe United Kingdom came together to work, as we\\ncontinue to do, on the Iran dossier before the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\\nI recognize, of course, the frustrations which all\\nof us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict,\\nwhere the clear path to peace set out in the road map\\nand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.\\nBut all in all we have shown the will to make collective\\naction work, though we know, too, that we need to go\\nfurther.\\nIn particular, we need to get better at tackling\\nthreats which have changed dramatically since the\\nfounding of the United Nations. Today the greatest\\nthreats to our security often come not from other\\nfunctioning sovereign States, but from terrorist\\norganizations, from failing States and from man-made\\nshocks to our environment like climate change, which\\ncan exacerbate State failure and breed internal\\ninstability.\\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General is\\npreparing its recommendations on ways to address the\\nvarious challenges. We should remember in all this that\\nwe have one great advantage. Though its institutions\\nand the founding text of the Charter has hardly\\nchanged in 60 years, the United Nations is not an\\norganization set in stone, but a set of living institutions\\nbased on a shared will to make collective security\\nwork. The United Nations has adapted in the past -\\nwith the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus\\non individual rights and the setting of global targets for\\n34\\n\\ndevelopment - and I am confident that it can adapt in\\nthe future.\\nOf course, institutional change is part of that. At\\nthe United Nations foundation, one eighth of its\\nmembers could expect to be elected members of the\\nSecurity Council at any one time. Today that\\nproportion is less than one eighteenth. The United\\nKingdom has long supported the case for expanding\\nthe Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for\\nincluding amongst the permanent members: Germany\\nand Japan, two countries which between them\\ncontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United\\nNations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire\\nworldís population; and Brazil, which just missed\\npermanent membership back in 1945.\\nBut we should not see an expansion of the\\nSecurity Council, or other institutional change, as a\\npanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common\\nunderstanding - the United Nations jurisprudence, if\\nyou like - and its operational effectiveness so that we\\ncan respond more quickly and more thoroughly to\\ntodayís new threats.\\nLet me highlight three areas which to me seem\\nparticularly important: first, our approach must be\\nbroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,\\nincluding poverty, disease and environmental\\ndegradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by\\nexpanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we\\nmust deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces\\nus all and everything for which we stand.\\nLet me now take these three points in turn. First,\\nthere is the need for a broader approach which\\naddresses the complex and interdependent nature of\\nsecurity today. Here, we have to do more to meet the\\nMillennium Development Goals and to promote\\nsustainable development, especially in Africa. We\\ncannot have security without development or\\ndevelopment without security.\\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his\\nspeech this week, we have to do more to entrench the\\nrule of law and justice, especially in States recovering\\nfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work\\non the Secretary-Generalís report during its Security\\nCouncil presidency next month.\\nWe could also use the United Nations better, to\\nagree to monitor and help implement globally accepted\\nnorms of good governance.\\nAnd we need to act together quickly on climate\\nchange, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our\\nworld in terms of stability and security. We have to\\nimplement Kyoto - and I greatly welcome what my\\ncolleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on\\nthat today - and agree to emission reductions beyond\\n2012.\\nMy second point is the need to build a new\\nconsensus on the scope of collective action. We all\\nrepresent independent, sovereign states. But even as we\\nfounded the United Nations we recognized that\\nsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nationís\\ngovernment: there to be respected, not abused, from\\neither without or within.\\nThe Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse\\nfrom without could be dealt with through the inherent\\nright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the\\nCharter. But it also said that an abuse from within\\nwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealt\\nwith by the Security Council, under the powers\\nenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the\\nCharter, and by the many conventions concluded\\nwithin the United Nations framework, including, for\\nexample, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer -\\nwe all said - could or should the world turn away\\nfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.\\nBut we have not always lived up to those high\\nexpectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia\\nten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to\\ndo so and to engage in situations of humanitarian\\ncatastrophe or grave violations of international\\nhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats\\nto international peace and security.\\nThe principle of non-interference has to be\\nqualified by a duty to protect, especially where\\nGovernments are failing in that duty.\\nWe therefore need, for example, to be ready to\\nsupport greater use by the Secretary-General of his\\npowers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats\\nto peace to the Security Council's attention. We have to\\nact quickly in response, because prevention is far better\\nthan cure. We should look to work more closely with\\nregional organizations, as we are doing with the\\nAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on\\nthe criteria as to when the international community\\nmight have to intervene with military force in extreme\\ncircumstances. We must get better at engaging for the\\nlong term in countries recovering from conflict,\\n35\\n\\ncoordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed\\npriorities.\\nMy third point is the urgent need to combat\\nglobal terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have\\nlearned anything in the three years since 11 September\\n2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate\\nin its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,\\nHindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion\\nor any religion, and of every or no shade of political\\nopinion, all have died through the terroristsí bullet or\\nbomb.\\nMy friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a\\nmoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible,\\nunspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that\\ntook place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears;\\nRussiaís tears are the worldís tears. We are all in the\\nfight against terrorism together.\\nToday in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to\\nwhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the\\nvictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts\\nand condolences are with the Government and people\\nof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims\\nof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping\\nIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.\\nOne of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held\\nhostage by terrorists who have already barbarically\\nmurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts\\nand prayers are with their families. We continue to do\\nall we can to secure Mr. Bigleyís release.\\nI know - how could I forget - that opinions\\nhave differed over the rightness of the military action\\ntaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no\\nnation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now\\noccurring there. For we all recognize that what is being\\nattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on\\nthe Iraqi people and on everything for which the\\nOrganization stands: safety, security and human rights.\\nWe have to come together to defeat the terrorists and\\ntheir despicable aims.\\nThe threat of terrorism confronts democratic,\\nproperly functioning States with an acute dilemma,\\nnamely, how to fight those who recognize none of the\\nvalues for which we stand while remaining true to\\nthose values. Our commitments under international\\nconventions express many of those values and the\\nimportance that we attach to them. But equally, those\\nconventions cannot be allowed to shelter those\\ninvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designed\\nto protect citizens from abuse by States, not by\\nterrorists.\\nThe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\\nRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear of\\npersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so\\nmany other nations have offered that protection when and\\nwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Convention\\nitself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does\\nnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a\\ncrime against humanity or other serious crime; nor\\ndoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary\\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\\nWe must never stoop to the level of the terrorist ó\\nto torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration ó\\nnor will any country within the European Union be\\nparty to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor\\nto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists\\nexploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not\\nthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall\\ntherefore be working closely with Russia on its\\nimportant draft Security Council resolution, to see how\\nbest we can prevent those who commit, support and\\nfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee\\nstatus to which they are not entitled. Along with the\\nRussian Federation and other partners in the Security\\nCouncil, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the\\nspeedier extradition of such individuals.\\nWe, the United Nations, have over the last year\\nbegun to show a new determination to come together\\nand to make collective action work. A year from now,\\nwe will meet again here to review the\\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\\nChallenges and Change, as well as the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals, and to set the United Nations\\nagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdomís\\nchairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on\\ntackling climate change and on Africa, on which the\\nIndependent Commission for Africa will be producing\\nrecommendations as to how best we can support the\\nradical agenda for change and development designed\\nby Africa itself through the New Partnership for\\nAfricaís Development and the African Union. Our\\npresidency of the European Union will help us to lead\\nefforts for a successful outcome in the Doha\\nDevelopment Round, and for building the European\\nUnionís crisis-management capabilities.\\nMore than ever, global security is our shared\\nresponsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to\\n36\\n\\nadapt to todayís threats and challenges, we must find\\nrenewed determination and political will to make\\ncollective security work. The United Kingdom is\\ndetermined to play its full part in that endeavour.</td>\n",

       "      <td>First, I would \\nlike to pay tribute to the work of the Secretary-General. \\nA former British Minister once said of the NATO \\nSecretary General that he should be more of a secretary \\nand less of a general. Kofi Annan has been more of \\neverything: more of a diplomat, more of a reformer and \\nmore of a moral voice of leadership in the world. \\n In a world shattered by conflict, the founders of \\nthe United Nations saw that only by coming together, \\nunited in support of larger freedom, could we build our \\nshared future. Today, when the world’s nations are \\neven more interdependent than they were in 1945, what \\ndoes it mean to stand, as they intended, united? At one \\nlevel it means taking action when things go wrong, \\nwhere there is an actual breakdown of security or a \\ndescent into violence or chaos. Today in particular, the \\nUnited Nations faces the challenges posed by multiple \\nupheavals and crises across the world. \\n In the Middle East the United Nations is playing \\na vital role in establishing stability in southern \\nLebanon. Troops from the European Union are \\ndeploying alongside those from the Middle East, Asia \\nand Africa. All Member States must meet their \\nobligations under Security Council resolutions 1701 \\n(2006), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), if we are to \\nenable Lebanon to be the proud, democratic and \\ndiverse nation that its people want it to be. \\n But we are all aware that this most recent conflict \\nin Lebanon had its roots in the continuing failure to \\nachieve a just solution to the Palestinian question. That \\nis why the United Kingdom has consistently argued \\nthat there can be no higher priority than reinvigorating \\nthe Middle East peace process. \\n In Iraq, Prime Minister Al-Maliki’s national \\nreconciliation plan can help leaders from all \\ncommunities come together. At this crucial juncture, \\nwe must all intensify our support. The International \\nCompact provides the right vehicle. It allows the Iraqi \\nGovernment to set its own vision and shows us how we \\ncan help turn that vision into a reality. \\n In Afghanistan, real progress has been made, with \\nthe United Nations taking a leading role in \\ncoordinating the international effort. But real \\nchallenges still lie ahead. NATO’s task of securing the \\nsouth of the country is far from easy. Soldiers from \\nmany NATO countries, not least my own, have given \\ntheir lives to provide a better future for the people of \\nAfghanistan. The Afghan Government and people, too, \\nwant security, development and good governance. The \\nUnited Kingdom and the international community are \\ndetermined to help them to achieve them. \\n We must show a similar shared determination in \\nurging the Government of Iran to address international \\nconcerns over its nuclear ambitions and its support for \\nterrorism. The proposals put forward by Britain, France \\nand Germany with China, Russia and the United States \\noffer a path for the Iranian Government to develop a \\nmore constructive relationship with the rest of the \\nworld and give Iran’s talented population the \\nopportunities and prosperity that is their right, \\nincluding, if they wish, a modern nuclear power \\nindustry. We want to be able to resume negotiations. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 20 \\n \\nIran knows what is required, and that the alternative is \\nincreasing isolation. \\n Darfur remains in crisis. I pay tribute to the \\nefforts of the African Union and its peacekeepers. \\nWednesday’s decision to extend their mandate averted \\na security vacuum. We must now strengthen the force \\nof the African Union Mission in the Sudan. But it can \\nonly be a temporary reprieve. We also need action \\nimmediately on the political and humanitarian front. \\nThose who have not signed the Darfur Peace \\nAgreement must do so. Those who have must abide by \\nits provisions. \\n To underpin that Agreement, we urgently need a \\ngreatly strengthened international presence on the \\nground, with the active engagement and support of \\nAsian and Muslim, as well as African, countries. That \\nis why the Security Council authorized the deployment \\nof United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur. I urge \\nPresident Bashir to extend the Sudan’s relations with \\nthe United Nations in a common purpose to bring \\nlasting peace and genuine stability to the whole of the \\nSudan. It is, above all, his responsibility. \\n The security challenges the world faces are real. \\nAs an international community we must deal with \\nthem. But standing united also requires us to take up a \\nsecond, deeper level of global responsibility, namely, \\ntackling the underlying problems that promote conflict \\nand underdevelopment. We must strive to promote \\nsound global values and to build multilateral systems \\nwithin which nations and individuals can cooperate, \\nco-exist and each achieve their potential. \\n Many representatives to the Assembly have \\nalready spoken of the need to accelerate progress \\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Progress on those Goals is a moral \\nimperative rooted in a concern for, and an \\nunderstanding of, our common humanity. But it is also \\na political imperative, because there will be no stability \\nand security in our global community while so many \\nmillions of men, women and children in that \\ncommunity face only a life of hunger, poverty, \\ninequality and disease. \\n The same is true for those whose lives are \\nshattered by conflict or blighted by injustice. The \\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \\nCouncil are new structures that give us new \\nopportunities and new impetus. At the same time, we \\nmust see a step change in efforts towards an \\ninternational arms trade treaty that will end the \\nirresponsible transfer of arms that fuel conflict and \\nfacilitate the abuse of human rights. That is why the \\nUnited Kingdom, with six other countries, will \\nintroduce a draft resolution in the First Committee to \\nestablish a process to work towards a legally binding \\ntreaty on the trade in all conventional arms. \\n Collectively, we have a responsibility to protect \\nhuman life and a duty to defend the international \\ninstitutions that help us as a community to achieve that \\ngoal. The answers lie not in division or in personal \\nattacks, but in the earnest and consistent pursuit of \\njustice and peace.  \\n Our collective responsibility to each other is \\nnowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed \\nby climate change. The British Prime Minister, Tony \\nBlair, made climate change one of our two G8 \\npriorities last year, alongside poverty reduction in \\nAfrica. When the Prime Minister appointed me as his \\nForeign Secretary, in May, he specifically charged me \\nwith putting climate security at the heart of our foreign \\npolicy. We will not solve that problem if we do not \\neach assume our share of the responsibility for tackling \\nit. Nobody can protect themselves from climate change \\nunless we protect each other by building a global basis \\nfor climate security. That goes to the heart of the \\nUnited Nations mission, and the United Nations must \\nbe at the heart of the solution. \\n To put it starkly, if we all try to freeride, we will \\nall end up in free fall, with accelerating climate change \\nthe result of our collective failure to respond in time to \\nthat shared threat that faces us all. Look just at the \\ndanger posed by rising sea levels. Potentially, that \\ncould cause massive damage to some of the key urban \\ncentres of our global civilization. London, Shanghai, \\nDhaka, Singapore, Amsterdam, Cairo and, yes, \\nManhattan are all at risk. That is why we must all — as \\nforeign ministers, heads of Government and heads of \\nState — be ready to do more, and do it more quickly. \\nOur climate presents us with an ever-growing threat to \\ninternational security. Dealing with climate change, by \\nboth adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to \\navert still greater damage, is no longer a choice, it is an \\nimperative. \\n We need common commitment and genuine \\naction. We must all be ready to find a way to get the \\nagenda moving beyond Kyoto. The Gleneagles \\ndialogue meeting in Mexico at the beginning of \\n \\n \\n21 06-53317 \\n \\nOctober will be one such opportunity, a chance for \\ndeveloped and developing countries to work together \\non that shared problem.  \\n If we do not act now, an unstable climate will \\nundermine our progress in all those other areas that \\nmatter to us, not least the Millennium Development \\nGoals themselves. Take one of the most basic needs of \\nall, water. Already perhaps two fifths of the world’s \\npopulation finds it hard to get the water they need. At \\nthe same time, many in the world rely on affordable \\nenergy to help lift themselves out of poverty — and, \\nindeed, perhaps to give them access to that water. But \\nthere is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by \\nburning fossil fuels, we accelerate climate change. That \\nmeans further disrupting water supplies. For some \\npeople who now have plenty of water it will mean new \\nshortages. For those who already have little, it will \\nmean less. In turn, everywhere less water means less \\nfood. \\n Let me give a specific example of that dilemma. \\nThe whole world, as well as the Chinese people, is \\nbenefiting from the great success of the Chinese \\neconomy. No one in China or elsewhere wants that \\ngrowth to stop. But it is based, in China as elsewhere, \\non a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are \\ncreating climate change. Yet China is a country already \\nvulnerable to climate change. The Chinese Government \\nknows that as the Himalayan glaciers melt and \\nagricultural land shrinks, crop yields will fall, fresh \\nwater will become more scarce and the economy itself \\nwill suffer, and with it the world’s economy. \\n All the nations of the Arctic Circle are being, and \\nwill be, affected by melting permafrost, with \\ndisruptions to infrastructure and to investment. The \\nVice-President of Palau has just given us a vivid \\ndescription of what the environment means for his \\nnation. We all share, to a greater or lesser extent, that \\nsame dilemma. If we do not act on climate change, we \\nrisk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and \\nsecurity we are seeking to achieve. That is why we \\nmust recognize that talk of having either a successful \\neconomy or a stable climate is a false choice. We must \\nwork together to find paths for economic growth that \\nwill protect our climate. The truth is that we already \\nhave much of the technology we need to move to a \\nlow-carbon economy. But we must now deploy it very \\nmuch more rapidly. What we do in the next 10 years \\nwill count the most.  \\n The former chief economist of the World Bank, \\nSir Nicholas Stern, will shortly publish one of the most \\nsignificant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the \\neconomic impacts of climate change itself. One of the \\nkey emerging findings of his work is that while it will \\nnot cost the Earth to solve climate change, it will cost \\nthe Earth, literally as well as financially, if we do not. \\n Moreover, if we learn to tackle climate change \\ntogether, we have an opportunity to build trust between \\nnations and to strengthen the multilateral system. But if \\nwe get it wrong, that trust will be further eroded. It is \\nthe developed, rich world that bears a large \\nresponsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas \\nemissions, but it is the poorest in our global \\ncommunity — those least able to bear it — who will \\nbear the brunt of climate insecurity. We all need to do \\nmore. But the rich world should of course continue to \\nlead the effort, applying the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibility, which must continue to be \\nour guide. In the joint endeavour which the United \\nNations represents there can be no more stark or more \\nurgent warning than that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is a great  honour to make my first speech to the General \\nAssembly. \\n The United Nations has a duty to lead the world \\nin addressing the shared threats and opportunities that \\ndominate our age, and it must do so in deed as well as \\nin word. That is why I want to use this platform to \\nexpress my admiration and support for United Nations \\nmissions around the world, from Lebanon to Liberia, \\nfrom Congo and Haiti to East Timor, which, even as we \\nmeet in New York this week, are saving lives and \\nspreading hope. \\n Since 1946, when the first meeting of the General \\nAssembly took place in London, the United Kingdom \\nhas been determined to fulfil its international \\nresponsibilities through the United Nations. The new \\nGovernment in the United Kingdom, under the \\nleadership of Gordon Brown, is proud to continue that \\ntradition, and I reaffirm our commitment today. \\n The focus at this session has been on immediate \\nand pressing issues. In the Middle East, we need urgent \\naction towards a two-State solution that addresses the \\nsecurity of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the \\nsame time.  \\n In Iraq, recent security gains can only be \\nsustained through continued support for the \\ndevelopment of the Iraqi security forces, through \\nnational reconciliation and through political support \\nfrom the whole region. \\n Our international community depends on \\nresponsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a \\nleading and respected country, it must cease its support \\nfor terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its \\ndefiance of three Security Council resolutions in \\nrespect of its nuclear programme. \\n In Zimbabwe, we need United Nations action to \\nsupport African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle \\nof economic and social devastation that now afflicts \\nthe country. \\n We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in \\nBurma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest, \\nencourage national dialogue and promote genuine \\nreconciliation. Let us today send a message to the \\nmonks on the streets of Burma: we support your \\ndemand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a \\nmessage from the monks on the streets of Burma: the \\nhuman desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or \\nreligion or region. It is good that the Burmese \\nGovernment has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the \\ncountry, but it is now vital that they use his presence \\nthere to start the process of reconciliation. \\n But as well as addressing the traumas of our \\nfellow citizens around the world, the United Nations \\nmust be the place where we address the longer-term \\nthreats. Today, I devote my speech to one of the great \\nthreats to stability and prosperity in the world: the \\nthreat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities \\nare not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. \\nInequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for \\nan open, global economy. It corrodes trust and respect \\nand reciprocity between nations. \\n The United Nations Charter talks of the \\n“sovereign equality of States”, and it also talks of the \\n“equal rights and dignity of men and women and of \\nnations large and small”. The principle of equality is \\nnowhere more evident than in the General Assembly \\nwhere all States have an equal voice. But in the world \\noutside this Hall, economic, social and political \\ninequalities within and between States persist and \\nworsen. We cannot stand united against the shared \\nthreats and opportunities in our world when we are so \\ndivided by economic and political disparities. So the \\nneed for Governments and international institutions to \\nreduce inequalities and promote our common humanity \\nis stark. \\n Traditionally, we have focused on the divide \\nbetween developed and developing nations. However, \\nthe growth rates in many developing countries are \\nfaster than in developed economies. That is the good \\nnews. But there remain around a billion people in the \\nworld   one sixth of its population   living in 58 \\ncountries, who have been left out of the story of human \\nprogress. This “bottom billion” have an average life \\nexpectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the \\nchildren in the bottom billion die before their fifth \\nbirthday, and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The \\ncountries that are home to the bottom billion saw their \\nnational incomes fall each year during the 1980s and \\n1990s. \\n Even where inequalities are narrowing between \\nnations, they are widening within them. According to \\nthe United Nations Development Programme, in 73 \\ncountries   containing 80 per cent of the world’s \\npopulation   economic inequality has risen in recent \\nyears. \\n Every nation represented here has responsibilities \\nto its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs \\nopen markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens \\nthrough democratic and transparent institutions, free \\nfrom corruption. It needs strong and effective \\neducation and health services open to all. \\n But national action is not enough. Because the \\ncauses of inequality cross national boundaries, we need \\ncooperation between nations, bilateral and multilateral, \\nled by the United Nations. \\n First, three quarters of the countries where the \\nbottom billion citizens reside have recent or current \\nexperience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to \\nextreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200,000 \\npeople are dead, 2 million are displaced and 4 million \\nare on food aid. As the international community, we \\ndecided on a course of action in Security Council \\nresolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: \\nan agreement on force composition, swift deployment, \\neffective protection of civilians on the ground and a \\npolitical process in which the legitimate grievance of \\nthe Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In \\nAfghanistan, one of the five poorest countries in the \\nworld, we need to back up military efforts to secure \\nsafe space with economic, social and political \\nreconstruction. \\n Beyond those crises, we also need to improve our \\ncapacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is \\nour vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical \\ndimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose \\neasy availability makes it so simple to set up militias \\nand provoke violence and mayhem. Last year, the \\nAssembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward \\nUnited Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see \\nresolution 61/89). The Government of the United \\nKingdom will continue to press for the achievement of \\nthat goal. \\n Secondly, freedom from conflict is the platform \\nfor progress, but the battle against disease and \\nilliteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some \\ncountries, the world is off track to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That is why, in July here \\nat the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the United \\nKingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own \\ncommitments and go further, to build a truly global \\npartnership   with the private sector, trade unions, \\nfaith groups, civil society and cities   that can meet \\nthe 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed \\nworld to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of \\nits national incomes on development. The United \\nKingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that \\nrequires shared responsibility. Poor governance and \\ncorruption are the enemies of development. \\n Thirdly, progress on aid needs to be combined \\nwith a new global trade deal that opens up economies \\non a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit \\nfrom subsidies and tariffs, particularly for agriculture. \\nHigher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor \\ncountries from diversifying their economies. That is a \\nbad deal for Western consumers, and it squeezes out \\nthe livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither \\nis it in rich countries’ financial self-interest, nor is it \\nfair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes \\nthat concluding the Doha trade round this year is not \\njust necessary, but also possible, and we will work to \\nachieve that goal. \\n Finally, we must address the greatest long-term \\nthreat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate \\nchange. Climate change affects all countries, but the \\npoorest countries   and the poorest people within \\nthose countries   will suffer the most disruption and \\ndevastation. I congratulate the President of the General \\nAssembly on choosing climate change as a central \\ntheme of this general debate. And I congratulate the \\nSecretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But \\nwe need more than debate. \\n The United Nations Framework Convention on \\nClimate Change is the only body that can conclude a \\nglobal agreement on climate change. Therefore, in the \\nnext two months we need an urgent agreement on the \\nsteps towards progress to be taken at the December \\nmeeting in Bali. Beyond that, we need a road map to \\nthe 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be \\nheld at Copenhagen in two years’ time, and agreement \\non a global deal that succeeds the end of the first \\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \\n At the heart of such an agreement must be the \\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities: \\nall countries taking on responsibilities, but making sure \\nthat they are equitably distributed, with the greatest \\naction taken by the richest countries. The United \\nKingdom stands ready to play its part. This year, our \\nclimate change bill will be enacted into law in the next \\nsession of Parliament to place on a statutory footing \\nour commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 \\nper cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we \\nneed similar binding commitments from all rich \\ncountries. \\n The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis \\nresolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, a new trade deal, climate \\nchange   they call for all our resources. Military \\nintervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes \\na solution cannot be found without armed force. \\nDevelopment budgets are necessary, but the developing \\nworld needs a growth plan, not just an aid plan. \\nDiplomacy needs to bridge differences between \\nnations, but also to reach out to civil society and \\nbusiness. \\n The United Kingdom is proud not just of its \\nbilateral relations with the countries represented in the \\nAssembly, but also of its commitment to multilateral \\ninstitutions, which can be a force for good in the world. \\nBut international institutions need to reflect the world \\nas it is, not the world as it was. The United Kingdom \\ntherefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental \\nnegotiations at this session to achieve agreement on \\nreform of the Security Council. We support permanent \\nmembership for Germany, Japan, India and Brazil and \\npermanent representation for Africa. We are not \\nwedded to a single model of reform. Achieving \\neffective change is what matters. \\n In a world where more than a billion people are \\nonline, where companies have bigger turnovers than \\ncountries and where global non-governmental \\norganizations have memberships that are bigger than \\nnational populations, our international institutions must \\nlook inwards to internal reform, but also outwards to \\nbroader popular movements for change. \\n In the last phase of globalization, in the \\nnineteenth century, the emergence of new Powers and \\nthe breakdown of the international order resulted in \\nconflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. \\nUnless we can build trust and reciprocity between \\nnations and embody them in durable and robust \\ninternational institutions that reconcile differences and \\nnurture common values, the latest phase of \\nglobalization could be another false dawn. \\n Globalization is not just something to which we \\nmust adapt; it is something that we can and must shape \\nfor the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to \\nuse spreading power, wealth and opportunity. For my \\nGovernment, this mission is driven by both moral \\npurpose and national interest. We must address the \\ninsecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders \\nif we are to enhance security and prosperity within our \\nborders. \\n We live in a more prosperous, more peaceful and \\nmore democratic world than ever before. Let us \\ncommit ourselves to living in a more equal world. \\n</td>\n",

To be sure, we had shown the right\\nconvictions in words, but shamefully, we had failed to\\nact. The lesson of that massacre — and of the even\\ngreater horror of Rwanda a year before — was that we\\nall needed better means to turn our collective will into\\ndecisive action. I think that we in the European Union\\nhave learned in the intervening period. Today, the\\nUnion is on the ground as a military, police or civilian\\npresence in Bosnia, in Aceh, in Iraq, in the Democratic\\nRepublic of the Congo and, with the African Union, in\\nDarfur.\\nI also think that the United Nations has learned\\nthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit this\\nweek, we agreed on the further steps that we need to\\ntake for the Organization to be even more effective. Of\\nall that was agreed at the summit, I believe it will be\\nthe agreement on our “responsibility to protect” that\\nwill be seen in the future as having the greatest\\nsignificance of all. If we follow through on the\\nresponsibility to protect, then never again will\\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\\nhumanity be allowed to take place under our noses\\nwith nothing done.\\nThe responsibility to protect is, of course, a\\nreflection of our common morality. But it is also a\\nrecognition that the world in which we now live is too\\nsmall for us to be unaffected by, or indifferent to, the\\ninnocent victims of murder and oppression. This\\nshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it has\\nbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell, a generation\\nof ideological certainties was swept away. People could\\nsuddenly see partners where before they had only\\nglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrier\\nwas noisily being breached, a revolution in information\\ntechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distance\\nand time. Continents and cultures are now cabled\\ntogether and bound by trade and services in a way that\\nwas unimaginable even a decade ago.\\nIn this new world, we can no longer safely\\ntolerate the general threat that can come from a\\nparticular human tragedy, wherever it takes place. To a\\ngreater extent than ever before, we share the same\\nworld: the same threats and responsibilities, the same\\nopportunities and interests. And precisely because the\\nboundaries of our world have contracted, the\\nhorizons — the ambitions — of many people around\\nthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time in\\nour history, mankind has the ability to realize the\\npotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and in\\nevery region through an open exchange of goods,\\ninvestment, technology and, above all, ideas.\\nNot least in all of this, it is the rise of India and\\nof China that is reordering the world economy.\\nHundreds of millions there and elsewhere have been\\nlifted out of poverty. A new global market has been\\ncreated that ignores the divide — which seemed so\\nfundamental for so many decades — between East and\\nWest.\\nCurrently, not everyone has the chance to share in\\nall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remains\\nblighted by poverty, disease and conflict. The\\nEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable to\\nachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief, trade\\nreform and development aid are all vital, but none of\\nthem can work alone. Fundamental to making poverty\\nhistory are the Governments of the developing world\\nthemselves. And where Governments fail, their own\\npeoples are the victims, as United Nations Special\\nEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka’s damning assessment of the\\nsituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.\\nSub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet to\\nachieve its potential. The American author Thomas\\nFriedman, in his recent book The World Is Flat,\\nhighlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arab\\npeoples whose forebears devised algebra and the\\nalgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based,\\nbut those peoples are now right at the rear of today’s\\ntechnological revolution, with, for example, fewer than\\n2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.\\nThree United Nations Development Programme Arab\\nHuman Development Reports have now set out clearly\\nhow limited economic prospects and stunted political\\nfreedoms have led young and talented people towards\\nalienation and disillusionment.\\nThe answer, however, does not lie in easy\\nstereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is only\\nthe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us to\\nbelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally\\n28\\n\\ndifferent. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust and\\ndespair, and we reject it utterly. Indonesia and\\nTurkey — to name just two — are both striking\\nexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslim\\npopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.\\nWe in the European Union have seen the vibrant\\nMuslim communities in our own countries, and from\\nthat experience have seen how Islamic and Western\\ncultures can be partners in a global society.\\nEveryone knows that the Arab peoples want\\nprosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much\\nas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that the\\nArab world has the lowest scores in regional\\nmeasurements of democratic practices, civil freedoms\\nand good governance is not some cultural inevitability,\\nbut a temporary failure of human will. In that regard,\\nthe international community has a clear responsibility\\nto encourage regionally led political, social and\\neconomic reform. The European Union strongly\\nsupports such reform and will continue to do so.\\nEqually, it has been our active foreign policy that has\\nplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran, especially on\\nthe nuclear dossier.\\nWith our High Representative Javier Solana and\\nmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues,\\nwe have made detailed proposals for the relationship\\nbetween the European Union and Iran to be based on\\ncooperation and respect for international norms and\\ntreaties.\\nOur proposals envisage a high-level, long-term\\npolitical and security framework between the European\\nUnion and Iran, in which we would work together in\\npolitical, economic, scientific and technological areas,\\nincluding the civil nuclear field, in return for Iran\\nproviding guarantees about its intentions and\\ncapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So, we will\\nlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon’s\\nspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic of\\nIran, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\\nOn Iraq, the European Union now has a\\ncomprehensive programme of engagement and has put\\nbehind it divisions over the military action two and a\\nhalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of a\\npeaceful, prosperous, democratic and stable nation.\\nWe are also giving very active support to the\\nQuartet’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace\\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, with two States\\nliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon’s\\nbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and\\nwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas’s work to build\\nthe first stage of an effective, viable State of Palestine.\\nIn July, the European Union again suffered the\\nhorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the target\\nwas my country, the United Kingdom: its capital,\\nLondon. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.\\nInternational terrorism requires an international\\nresponse; otherwise, we all pay the price for each\\nother’s vulnerabilities. The ratification of a\\ncomprehensive treaty on terrorism is, therefore, at the\\nhighest priority.\\nBut the threat from terrorists and the political\\ninstability they bring is made worse by the easy\\navailability of weapons in what has become an\\nanarchic, unregulated international trade. These same\\nweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia a\\ndecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in the\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.\\nWe already have international instruments to regulate\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We in the\\nEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms control\\nregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that the\\ntime has now come for this Organization to embrace\\nthe idea of an international arms trade treaty, which\\nwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.\\nIt was in the killing fields of Europe, in two\\nsuccessive wars, that the twin ideas of the United\\nNations and of the European Union became imperative.\\nToday, the European Union’s commitment to the\\nUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.\\nAnd it is reflected in what we give in voluntary\\ndonations and to the regular budget and peacekeeping\\noperations.\\nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations\\nremains today what it was at its foundation: to remove\\nthe scourge of war, to reaffirm the worth of the human\\nperson and to promote social progress and better\\nstandards of life. In this changed and changing world,\\nit is the responsibility of us all to ensure that this\\nOrganization has the powers and the resources to\\nachieve all these aims.   \n",

Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by those\\nwho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic,\\nprosperous future they so richly deserve. The best\\nservice that we can render her memory is to defeat the\\nterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful,\\nfree Iraq prevails.\\nOf course, we owe this service to all those who\\nhave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieira\\nde Mello and the United Nations personnel who were\\nkilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 August\\nwere committed to bringing the ideals of the United\\nNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimate\\nsacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss, but\\nwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqi\\npeople rebuild their country on the principles of justice\\nand security.\\nWhat, I think, makes Iraq so important was the\\nway in which it tested the role and purpose of this\\ninstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughout\\nthat period, the international community remained in\\nagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a\\nChapter VII threat to international peace and security\\nby its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\nprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will of\\nthe United Nations. Yet, earlier this year, sadly, we\\ndivided on when and what action was necessary to deal\\nwith the Iraqi threat.\\nOf course, I acknowledge the controversy over\\nthe military action which the United Kingdom, the\\nUnited States and others took and the heavy\\nresponsibilities we now bear, but I firmly believe that\\nthe decisions we took were the right ones. The\\nauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Having\\ngiven Saddam Hussein’s regime a final opportunity to\\ncomply with the United Nations, what would have\\nhappened if we had simply turned away? Would the\\nworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a better\\nplace today? Would the United Nations be a stronger\\ninstitution today? The answer to each of those\\nquestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have been\\nemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator would\\nhave been encouraged to follow his example; and the\\nauthority of this United Nations would have been\\ngravely weakened.\\nYet, whatever the arguments of the spring, we\\nhave now to come together again for a common\\npurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in its\\nthree resolutions 1472 (2003), 1483 (2003) and 1500\\n(2003), we have a shared interest in helping Iraqi\\ncitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which they\\nhave been denied so long and for which this institution\\nwas founded. Yes, the security situation does present\\nformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedom\\nare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They have\\ninflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people, coalition\\nsoldiers and international aid workers, but ultimately\\nthey will fail.\\nAnd let us also not lose sight of what has been\\nachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein’s\\nreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture and\\noppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of\\n31\\n \\nlives is at an end. Instead, we have the beginnings of a\\nrepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;\\nnew ministries providing daily services to the people; a\\nfree press; the freedom for members of all religious\\ncommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals and\\nschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets and\\nhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.\\nWe shall stay in Iraq as long, but only as long, as\\nit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and to\\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as we\\ncan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we can\\nagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthen\\nthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing this\\ntransition, we should be guided by three central\\nprinciples: first, the transfer of powers must reflect\\nrealities on the ground in Iraq, particularly the need to\\nensure security; secondly, the Iraqi institutions must be\\nsufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;\\nand thirdly, the exercise of executive powers and\\nresponsibilities must be based on good governance,\\ninvolving representative Iraqi authorities and coherent\\nconstitutional arrangements. In other words, the timetable\\nshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and their\\ncapacity progressively to assume democratic control,\\nrather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.\\nIraq is, sadly, not the only territory in the Middle\\nEast where the international community faces great\\nchallenges. Three months ago, we all had high hopes\\nabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations,\\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and the\\nUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It is\\ntragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 August\\nby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem, which came only\\na few hours after the terrorist atrocity against the\\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, but the international\\ncommunity has to stay united on both the means and\\nthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternatives\\nto the road map and there can be no alternatives to the\\noutcome the entire world wishes to see — two States,\\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and\\nsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to the\\nthousands who have died on both sides since the\\nbeginning of this appalling conflict.\\nThe breadth of the issues being tackled by the\\nUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates the\\ncontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-\\nTerrorism Committee has given the United Nations a\\nfocus for its work following  September two years\\nago, but we must now build upon that work, giving the\\nCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce the\\ncapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcome\\nterrorism.\\nWe also know that proliferation is one of the\\ngreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Much\\ngood work on proliferation is being done by United\\nNations agencies, particularly the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency, but it is extraordinary that the Security\\nCouncil itself has not addressed the issue of\\nproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement, it is\\ntime that it did.\\nProblems of internal conflict, on the other hand,\\nare regularly on the Security Council’s agenda. The\\nUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experience\\nin this area and has achieved great things in countries\\nas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone, but nation-\\nbuilding is a collaborative effort, requiring the\\nresources and commitment of Member States if the\\nUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. We\\ntherefore need new mechanisms to help prevent\\nconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.\\nWe must also make a real success of the\\nMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome the\\nsetback of Cancún and secure a positive outcome to the\\nDoha Round.\\nThese and other shared problems require\\ncollective responses, as our Secretary-General so\\neloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key to\\nthis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remains\\nan effective global forum capable of delivering results.\\nThe Secretary-General posed some difficult questions\\ntwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek the\\nadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals on\\nreform. I welcome, too, his parallel commitment to\\nmodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.\\nFor our part, the United Kingdom is committed to\\nmaking the Security Council more representative. The\\nissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger and\\nmore representative Council, however, will not of itself\\nmake it easier to make the tough choices which it has\\nto face so often. The most important ingredient is the\\npolitical will and determination of the members of the\\nCouncil to take effective action.\\nThe most important part of the Secretary-\\nGeneral’s speech on Tuesday was about the choices\\nnow confronting the United Nations. He was right\\nabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.\\n32\\n \\nDown one route lies a world in which the United\\nNations strengthens its role as the collective instrument\\nfor protecting our peace and security; down the other\\nroute lies a world in which collective action becomes a\\nsynonym for “inaction”. We must not take this second\\nroute. The Secretary-General’s speech was a challenge\\nto all of us. We all share a world in which international\\nterrorists strike down the innocent, regardless of faith\\nor nationality, and we are all less secure when weapons\\nof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do not\\nhave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism, while\\nproposing no multilateral means of confronting and\\ndealing with these threats.\\nThe British Government is profoundly\\ncommitted, as it always has been, to the ideals of the\\nUnited Nations. To us, the importance of this\\nOrganization has always been its ability to put those\\nhigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedly\\nwith the Secretary-General and the international\\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations retains\\nand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",
       "18  Mr. President, I\\noffer my congratulations and those of my country on\\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\\nits fifty-ninth session.\\nEighteen months ago, the United Nations faced\\ndivisions more serious than any since the Cuban\\nmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether\\nthe strength and unity which we had built up since the\\nend of the cold war could survive.\\nThen last year we watched, as Secretary-General\\nKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.\\nIn the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided\\nto follow our Secretary-Generalís directions. This\\nOrganization has not been plunged, as some predicted,\\ninto paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if\\nunspoken determination to make the United Nations\\nwork, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central\\ntask: to secure peace around the world.\\nOver the last 12 months we have dealt with new\\ncrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we\\nhave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government\\nand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great\\nLakes; mobilized international support for the new\\nIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important\\nsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they should\\nin the media ó Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste,\\nBougainville and Western Sahara.\\nWe have shown in those actions the unity of\\npurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our\\nhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.\\nAnd the search for consensus has not been confined to\\nthe Security Council.\\nI am proud that just a few months after the\\ndifficult times of early last year, France, Germany and\\nthe United Kingdom came together to work, as we\\ncontinue to do, on the Iran dossier before the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\\nI recognize, of course, the frustrations which all\\nof us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict,\\nwhere the clear path to peace set out in the road map\\nand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.\\nBut all in all we have shown the will to make collective\\naction work, though we know, too, that we need to go\\nfurther.\\nIn particular, we need to get better at tackling\\nthreats which have changed dramatically since the\\nfounding of the United Nations. Today the greatest\\nthreats to our security often come not from other\\nfunctioning sovereign States, but from terrorist\\norganizations, from failing States and from man-made\\nshocks to our environment like climate change, which\\ncan exacerbate State failure and breed internal\\ninstability.\\nThe High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and\\nChange appointed by the Secretary-General is\\npreparing its recommendations on ways to address the\\nvarious challenges. We should remember in all this that\\nwe have one great advantage. Though its institutions\\nand the founding text of the Charter has hardly\\nchanged in 60 years, the United Nations is not an\\norganization set in stone, but a set of living institutions\\nbased on a shared will to make collective security\\nwork. The United Nations has adapted in the past -\\nwith the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus\\non individual rights and the setting of global targets for\\n34\\n\\ndevelopment - and I am confident that it can adapt in\\nthe future.\\nOf course, institutional change is part of that. At\\nthe United Nations foundation, one eighth of its\\nmembers could expect to be elected members of the\\nSecurity Council at any one time. Today that\\nproportion is less than one eighteenth. The United\\nKingdom has long supported the case for expanding\\nthe Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for\\nincluding amongst the permanent members: Germany\\nand Japan, two countries which between them\\ncontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United\\nNations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire\\nworldís population; and Brazil, which just missed\\npermanent membership back in 1945.\\nBut we should not see an expansion of the\\nSecurity Council, or other institutional change, as a\\npanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common\\nunderstanding - the United Nations jurisprudence, if\\nyou like - and its operational effectiveness so that we\\ncan respond more quickly and more thoroughly to\\ntodayís new threats.\\nLet me highlight three areas which to me seem\\nparticularly important: first, our approach must be\\nbroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,\\nincluding poverty, disease and environmental\\ndegradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by\\nexpanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we\\nmust deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces\\nus all and everything for which we stand.\\nLet me now take these three points in turn. First,\\nthere is the need for a broader approach which\\naddresses the complex and interdependent nature of\\nsecurity today. Here, we have to do more to meet the\\nMillennium Development Goals and to promote\\nsustainable development, especially in Africa. We\\ncannot have security without development or\\ndevelopment without security.\\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his\\nspeech this week, we have to do more to entrench the\\nrule of law and justice, especially in States recovering\\nfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work\\non the Secretary-Generalís report during its Security\\nCouncil presidency next month.\\nWe could also use the United Nations better, to\\nagree to monitor and help implement globally accepted\\nnorms of good governance.\\nAnd we need to act together quickly on climate\\nchange, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our\\nworld in terms of stability and security. We have to\\nimplement Kyoto - and I greatly welcome what my\\ncolleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on\\nthat today - and agree to emission reductions beyond\\n2012.\\nMy second point is the need to build a new\\nconsensus on the scope of collective action. We all\\nrepresent independent, sovereign states. But even as we\\nfounded the United Nations we recognized that\\nsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nationís\\ngovernment: there to be respected, not abused, from\\neither without or within.\\nThe Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse\\nfrom without could be dealt with through the inherent\\nright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the\\nCharter. But it also said that an abuse from within\\nwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealt\\nwith by the Security Council, under the powers\\nenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the\\nCharter, and by the many conventions concluded\\nwithin the United Nations framework, including, for\\nexample, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer -\\nwe all said - could or should the world turn away\\nfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.\\nBut we have not always lived up to those high\\nexpectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia\\nten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to\\ndo so and to engage in situations of humanitarian\\ncatastrophe or grave violations of international\\nhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats\\nto international peace and security.\\nThe principle of non-interference has to be\\nqualified by a duty to protect, especially where\\nGovernments are failing in that duty.\\nWe therefore need, for example, to be ready to\\nsupport greater use by the Secretary-General of his\\npowers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats\\nto peace to the Security Council's attention. We have to\\nact quickly in response, because prevention is far better\\nthan cure. We should look to work more closely with\\nregional organizations, as we are doing with the\\nAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on\\nthe criteria as to when the international community\\nmight have to intervene with military force in extreme\\ncircumstances. We must get better at engaging for the\\nlong term in countries recovering from conflict,\\n35\\n\\ncoordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed\\npriorities.\\nMy third point is the urgent need to combat\\nglobal terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have\\nlearned anything in the three years since 11 September\\n2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate\\nin its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,\\nHindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion\\nor any religion, and of every or no shade of political\\nopinion, all have died through the terroristsí bullet or\\nbomb.\\nMy friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a\\nmoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible,\\nunspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that\\ntook place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears;\\nRussiaís tears are the worldís tears. We are all in the\\nfight against terrorism together.\\nToday in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to\\nwhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the\\nvictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts\\nand condolences are with the Government and people\\nof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims\\nof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping\\nIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.\\nOne of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held\\nhostage by terrorists who have already barbarically\\nmurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts\\nand prayers are with their families. We continue to do\\nall we can to secure Mr. Bigleyís release.\\nI know - how could I forget - that opinions\\nhave differed over the rightness of the military action\\ntaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no\\nnation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now\\noccurring there. For we all recognize that what is being\\nattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on\\nthe Iraqi people and on everything for which the\\nOrganization stands: safety, security and human rights.\\nWe have to come together to defeat the terrorists and\\ntheir despicable aims.\\nThe threat of terrorism confronts democratic,\\nproperly functioning States with an acute dilemma,\\nnamely, how to fight those who recognize none of the\\nvalues for which we stand while remaining true to\\nthose values. Our commitments under international\\nconventions express many of those values and the\\nimportance that we attach to them. But equally, those\\nconventions cannot be allowed to shelter those\\ninvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designed\\nto protect citizens from abuse by States, not by\\nterrorists.\\nThe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\\nRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear of\\npersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so\\nmany other nations have offered that protection when and\\nwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Convention\\nitself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does\\nnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a\\ncrime against humanity or other serious crime; nor\\ndoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary\\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\\nWe must never stoop to the level of the terrorist ó\\nto torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration ó\\nnor will any country within the European Union be\\nparty to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor\\nto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists\\nexploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not\\nthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall\\ntherefore be working closely with Russia on its\\nimportant draft Security Council resolution, to see how\\nbest we can prevent those who commit, support and\\nfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee\\nstatus to which they are not entitled. Along with the\\nRussian Federation and other partners in the Security\\nCouncil, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the\\nspeedier extradition of such individuals.\\nWe, the United Nations, have over the last year\\nbegun to show a new determination to come together\\nand to make collective action work. A year from now,\\nwe will meet again here to review the\\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats,\\nChallenges and Change, as well as the Millennium\\nDevelopment Goals, and to set the United Nations\\nagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdomís\\nchairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on\\ntackling climate change and on Africa, on which the\\nIndependent Commission for Africa will be producing\\nrecommendations as to how best we can support the\\nradical agenda for change and development designed\\nby Africa itself through the New Partnership for\\nAfricaís Development and the African Union. Our\\npresidency of the European Union will help us to lead\\nefforts for a successful outcome in the Doha\\nDevelopment Round, and for building the European\\nUnionís crisis-management capabilities.\\nMore than ever, global security is our shared\\nresponsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to\\n36\\n\\nadapt to todayís threats and challenges, we must find\\nrenewed determination and political will to make\\ncollective security work. The United Kingdom is\\ndetermined to play its full part in that endeavour.   \n",

Kofi Annan has been more of \\neverything: more of a diplomat, more of a reformer and \\nmore of a moral voice of leadership in the world. \\n In a world shattered by conflict, the founders of \\nthe United Nations saw that only by coming together, \\nunited in support of larger freedom, could we build our \\nshared future. Today, when the world’s nations are \\neven more interdependent than they were in 1945, what \\ndoes it mean to stand, as they intended, united? At one \\nlevel it means taking action when things go wrong, \\nwhere there is an actual breakdown of security or a \\ndescent into violence or chaos. Today in particular, the \\nUnited Nations faces the challenges posed by multiple \\nupheavals and crises across the world. \\n In the Middle East the United Nations is playing \\na vital role in establishing stability in southern \\nLebanon. Troops from the European Union are \\ndeploying alongside those from the Middle East, Asia \\nand Africa. All Member States must meet their \\nobligations under Security Council resolutions 1701 \\n(2006), 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), if we are to \\nenable Lebanon to be the proud, democratic and \\ndiverse nation that its people want it to be. \\n But we are all aware that this most recent conflict \\nin Lebanon had its roots in the continuing failure to \\nachieve a just solution to the Palestinian question. That \\nis why the United Kingdom has consistently argued \\nthat there can be no higher priority than reinvigorating \\nthe Middle East peace process. \\n In Iraq, Prime Minister Al-Maliki’s national \\nreconciliation plan can help leaders from all \\ncommunities come together. At this crucial juncture, \\nwe must all intensify our support. The International \\nCompact provides the right vehicle. It allows the Iraqi \\nGovernment to set its own vision and shows us how we \\ncan help turn that vision into a reality. \\n In Afghanistan, real progress has been made, with \\nthe United Nations taking a leading role in \\ncoordinating the international effort. But real \\nchallenges still lie ahead. NATO’s task of securing the \\nsouth of the country is far from easy. Soldiers from \\nmany NATO countries, not least my own, have given \\ntheir lives to provide a better future for the people of \\nAfghanistan. The Afghan Government and people, too, \\nwant security, development and good governance. The \\nUnited Kingdom and the international community are \\ndetermined to help them to achieve them. \\n We must show a similar shared determination in \\nurging the Government of Iran to address international \\nconcerns over its nuclear ambitions and its support for \\nterrorism. The proposals put forward by Britain, France \\nand Germany with China, Russia and the United States \\noffer a path for the Iranian Government to develop a \\nmore constructive relationship with the rest of the \\nworld and give Iran’s talented population the \\nopportunities and prosperity that is their right, \\nincluding, if they wish, a modern nuclear power \\nindustry. We want to be able to resume negotiations. \\n  \\n \\n06-53317 20 \\n \\nIran knows what is required, and that the alternative is \\nincreasing isolation. \\n Darfur remains in crisis. I pay tribute to the \\nefforts of the African Union and its peacekeepers. \\nWednesday’s decision to extend their mandate averted \\na security vacuum. We must now strengthen the force \\nof the African Union Mission in the Sudan. But it can \\nonly be a temporary reprieve. We also need action \\nimmediately on the political and humanitarian front. \\nThose who have not signed the Darfur Peace \\nAgreement must do so. Those who have must abide by \\nits provisions. \\n To underpin that Agreement, we urgently need a \\ngreatly strengthened international presence on the \\nground, with the active engagement and support of \\nAsian and Muslim, as well as African, countries. That \\nis why the Security Council authorized the deployment \\nof United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur. I urge \\nPresident Bashir to extend the Sudan’s relations with \\nthe United Nations in a common purpose to bring \\nlasting peace and genuine stability to the whole of the \\nSudan. It is, above all, his responsibility. \\n The security challenges the world faces are real. \\nAs an international community we must deal with \\nthem. But standing united also requires us to take up a \\nsecond, deeper level of global responsibility, namely, \\ntackling the underlying problems that promote conflict \\nand underdevelopment. We must strive to promote \\nsound global values and to build multilateral systems \\nwithin which nations and individuals can cooperate, \\nco-exist and each achieve their potential. \\n Many representatives to the Assembly have \\nalready spoken of the need to accelerate progress \\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Progress on those Goals is a moral \\nimperative rooted in a concern for, and an \\nunderstanding of, our common humanity. But it is also \\na political imperative, because there will be no stability \\nand security in our global community while so many \\nmillions of men, women and children in that \\ncommunity face only a life of hunger, poverty, \\ninequality and disease. \\n The same is true for those whose lives are \\nshattered by conflict or blighted by injustice. The \\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \\nCouncil are new structures that give us new \\nopportunities and new impetus. At the same time, we \\nmust see a step change in efforts towards an \\ninternational arms trade treaty that will end the \\nirresponsible transfer of arms that fuel conflict and \\nfacilitate the abuse of human rights. That is why the \\nUnited Kingdom, with six other countries, will \\nintroduce a draft resolution in the First Committee to \\nestablish a process to work towards a legally binding \\ntreaty on the trade in all conventional arms. \\n Collectively, we have a responsibility to protect \\nhuman life and a duty to defend the international \\ninstitutions that help us as a community to achieve that \\ngoal. The answers lie not in division or in personal \\nattacks, but in the earnest and consistent pursuit of \\njustice and peace.  \\n Our collective responsibility to each other is \\nnowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed \\nby climate change. The British Prime Minister, Tony \\nBlair, made climate change one of our two G8 \\npriorities last year, alongside poverty reduction in \\nAfrica. When the Prime Minister appointed me as his \\nForeign Secretary, in May, he specifically charged me \\nwith putting climate security at the heart of our foreign \\npolicy. We will not solve that problem if we do not \\neach assume our share of the responsibility for tackling \\nit. Nobody can protect themselves from climate change \\nunless we protect each other by building a global basis \\nfor climate security. That goes to the heart of the \\nUnited Nations mission, and the United Nations must \\nbe at the heart of the solution. \\n To put it starkly, if we all try to freeride, we will \\nall end up in free fall, with accelerating climate change \\nthe result of our collective failure to respond in time to \\nthat shared threat that faces us all. Look just at the \\ndanger posed by rising sea levels. Potentially, that \\ncould cause massive damage to some of the key urban \\ncentres of our global civilization. London, Shanghai, \\nDhaka, Singapore, Amsterdam, Cairo and, yes, \\nManhattan are all at risk. That is why we must all — as \\nforeign ministers, heads of Government and heads of \\nState — be ready to do more, and do it more quickly. \\nOur climate presents us with an ever-growing threat to \\ninternational security. Dealing with climate change, by \\nboth adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to \\navert still greater damage, is no longer a choice, it is an \\nimperative. \\n We need common commitment and genuine \\naction. We must all be ready to find a way to get the \\nagenda moving beyond Kyoto. The Gleneagles \\ndialogue meeting in Mexico at the beginning of \\n \\n \\n21 06-53317 \\n \\nOctober will be one such opportunity, a chance for \\ndeveloped and developing countries to work together \\non that shared problem.  \\n If we do not act now, an unstable climate will \\nundermine our progress in all those other areas that \\nmatter to us, not least the Millennium Development \\nGoals themselves. Take one of the most basic needs of \\nall, water. Already perhaps two fifths of the world’s \\npopulation finds it hard to get the water they need. At \\nthe same time, many in the world rely on affordable \\nenergy to help lift themselves out of poverty — and, \\nindeed, perhaps to give them access to that water. But \\nthere is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by \\nburning fossil fuels, we accelerate climate change. That \\nmeans further disrupting water supplies. For some \\npeople who now have plenty of water it will mean new \\nshortages. For those who already have little, it will \\nmean less. In turn, everywhere less water means less \\nfood. \\n Let me give a specific example of that dilemma. \\nThe whole world, as well as the Chinese people, is \\nbenefiting from the great success of the Chinese \\neconomy. No one in China or elsewhere wants that \\ngrowth to stop. But it is based, in China as elsewhere, \\non a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are \\ncreating climate change. Yet China is a country already \\nvulnerable to climate change. The Chinese Government \\nknows that as the Himalayan glaciers melt and \\nagricultural land shrinks, crop yields will fall, fresh \\nwater will become more scarce and the economy itself \\nwill suffer, and with it the world’s economy. \\n All the nations of the Arctic Circle are being, and \\nwill be, affected by melting permafrost, with \\ndisruptions to infrastructure and to investment. The \\nVice-President of Palau has just given us a vivid \\ndescription of what the environment means for his \\nnation. We all share, to a greater or lesser extent, that \\nsame dilemma. If we do not act on climate change, we \\nrisk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and \\nsecurity we are seeking to achieve. That is why we \\nmust recognize that talk of having either a successful \\neconomy or a stable climate is a false choice. We must \\nwork together to find paths for economic growth that \\nwill protect our climate. The truth is that we already \\nhave much of the technology we need to move to a \\nlow-carbon economy. But we must now deploy it very \\nmuch more rapidly. What we do in the next 10 years \\nwill count the most.  \\n The former chief economist of the World Bank, \\nSir Nicholas Stern, will shortly publish one of the most \\nsignificant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the \\neconomic impacts of climate change itself. One of the \\nkey emerging findings of his work is that while it will \\nnot cost the Earth to solve climate change, it will cost \\nthe Earth, literally as well as financially, if we do not. \\n Moreover, if we learn to tackle climate change \\ntogether, we have an opportunity to build trust between \\nnations and to strengthen the multilateral system. But if \\nwe get it wrong, that trust will be further eroded. It is \\nthe developed, rich world that bears a large \\nresponsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas \\nemissions, but it is the poorest in our global \\ncommunity — those least able to bear it — who will \\nbear the brunt of climate insecurity. We all need to do \\nmore. But the rich world should of course continue to \\nlead the effort, applying the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibility, which must continue to be \\nour guide. In the joint endeavour which the United \\nNations represents there can be no more stark or more \\nurgent warning than that.    \n",
       "32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It is a great  honour to make my first speech to the General \\nAssembly. \\n The United Nations has a duty to lead the world \\nin addressing the shared threats and opportunities that \\ndominate our age, and it must do so in deed as well as \\nin word. That is why I want to use this platform to \\nexpress my admiration and support for United Nations \\nmissions around the world, from Lebanon to Liberia, \\nfrom Congo and Haiti to East Timor, which, even as we \\nmeet in New York this week, are saving lives and \\nspreading hope. \\n Since 1946, when the first meeting of the General \\nAssembly took place in London, the United Kingdom \\nhas been determined to fulfil its international \\nresponsibilities through the United Nations. The new \\nGovernment in the United Kingdom, under the \\nleadership of Gordon Brown, is proud to continue that \\ntradition, and I reaffirm our commitment today. \\n The focus at this session has been on immediate \\nand pressing issues. In the Middle East, we need urgent \\naction towards a two-State solution that addresses the \\nsecurity of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the \\nsame time.  \\n In Iraq, recent security gains can only be \\nsustained through continued support for the \\ndevelopment of the Iraqi security forces, through \\nnational reconciliation and through political support \\nfrom the whole region. \\n Our international community depends on \\nresponsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a \\nleading and respected country, it must cease its support \\nfor terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its \\ndefiance of three Security Council resolutions in \\nrespect of its nuclear programme. \\n In Zimbabwe, we need United Nations action to \\nsupport African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle \\nof economic and social devastation that now afflicts \\nthe country. \\n We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in \\nBurma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest, \\nencourage national dialogue and promote genuine \\nreconciliation. Let us today send a message to the \\nmonks on the streets of Burma: we support your \\ndemand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a \\nmessage from the monks on the streets of Burma: the \\nhuman desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or \\nreligion or region. It is good that the Burmese \\nGovernment has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the \\ncountry, but it is now vital that they use his presence \\nthere to start the process of reconciliation. \\n But as well as addressing the traumas of our \\nfellow citizens around the world, the United Nations \\nmust be the place where we address the longer-term \\nthreats. Today, I devote my speech to one of the great \\nthreats to stability and prosperity in the world: the \\nthreat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities \\nare not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. \\nInequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for \\nan open, global economy. It corrodes trust and respect \\nand reciprocity between nations. \\n The United Nations Charter talks of the \\n“sovereign equality of States”, and it also talks of the \\n“equal rights and dignity of men and women and of \\nnations large and small”. The principle of equality is \\nnowhere more evident than in the General Assembly \\nwhere all States have an equal voice. But in the world \\noutside this Hall, economic, social and political \\ninequalities within and between States persist and \\nworsen. We cannot stand united against the shared \\nthreats and opportunities in our world when we are so \\ndivided by economic and political disparities. So the \\nneed for Governments and international institutions to \\nreduce inequalities and promote our common humanity \\nis stark. \\n Traditionally, we have focused on the divide \\nbetween developed and developing nations. However, \\nthe growth rates in many developing countries are \\nfaster than in developed economies. That is the good \\nnews. But there remain around a billion people in the \\nworld   one sixth of its population   living in 58 \\ncountries, who have been left out of the story of human \\nprogress. This “bottom billion” have an average life \\nexpectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the \\nchildren in the bottom billion die before their fifth \\nbirthday, and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The \\ncountries that are home to the bottom billion saw their \\nnational incomes fall each year during the 1980s and \\n1990s. \\n Even where inequalities are narrowing between \\nnations, they are widening within them. According to \\nthe United Nations Development Programme, in 73 \\ncountries   containing 80 per cent of the world’s \\npopulation   economic inequality has risen in recent \\nyears. \\n Every nation represented here has responsibilities \\nto its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs \\nopen markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens \\nthrough democratic and transparent institutions, free \\nfrom corruption. It needs strong and effective \\neducation and health services open to all. \\n But national action is not enough. Because the \\ncauses of inequality cross national boundaries, we need \\ncooperation between nations, bilateral and multilateral, \\nled by the United Nations. \\n First, three quarters of the countries where the \\nbottom billion citizens reside have recent or current \\nexperience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to \\nextreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200,000 \\npeople are dead, 2 million are displaced and 4 million \\nare on food aid. As the international community, we \\ndecided on a course of action in Security Council \\nresolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: \\nan agreement on force composition, swift deployment, \\neffective protection of civilians on the ground and a \\npolitical process in which the legitimate grievance of \\nthe Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In \\nAfghanistan, one of the five poorest countries in the \\nworld, we need to back up military efforts to secure \\nsafe space with economic, social and political \\nreconstruction. \\n Beyond those crises, we also need to improve our \\ncapacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is \\nour vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical \\ndimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose \\neasy availability makes it so simple to set up militias \\nand provoke violence and mayhem. Last year, the \\nAssembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward \\nUnited Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see \\nresolution 61/89). The Government of the United \\nKingdom will continue to press for the achievement of \\nthat goal. \\n Secondly, freedom from conflict is the platform \\nfor progress, but the battle against disease and \\nilliteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some \\ncountries, the world is off track to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That is why, in July here \\nat the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the United \\nKingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own \\ncommitments and go further, to build a truly global \\npartnership   with the private sector, trade unions, \\nfaith groups, civil society and cities   that can meet \\nthe 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed \\nworld to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of \\nits national incomes on development. The United \\nKingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that \\nrequires shared responsibility. Poor governance and \\ncorruption are the enemies of development. \\n Thirdly, progress on aid needs to be combined \\nwith a new global trade deal that opens up economies \\non a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit \\nfrom subsidies and tariffs, particularly for agriculture. \\nHigher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor \\ncountries from diversifying their economies. That is a \\nbad deal for Western consumers, and it squeezes out \\nthe livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither \\nis it in rich countries’ financial self-interest, nor is it \\nfair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes \\nthat concluding the Doha trade round this year is not \\njust necessary, but also possible, and we will work to \\nachieve that goal. \\n Finally, we must address the greatest long-term \\nthreat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate \\nchange. Climate change affects all countries, but the \\npoorest countries   and the poorest people within \\nthose countries   will suffer the most disruption and \\ndevastation. I congratulate the President of the General \\nAssembly on choosing climate change as a central \\ntheme of this general debate. And I congratulate the \\nSecretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But \\nwe need more than debate. \\n The United Nations Framework Convention on \\nClimate Change is the only body that can conclude a \\nglobal agreement on climate change. Therefore, in the \\nnext two months we need an urgent agreement on the \\nsteps towards progress to be taken at the December \\nmeeting in Bali. Beyond that, we need a road map to \\nthe 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be \\nheld at Copenhagen in two years’ time, and agreement \\non a global deal that succeeds the end of the first \\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \\n At the heart of such an agreement must be the \\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities: \\nall countries taking on responsibilities, but making sure \\nthat they are equitably distributed, with the greatest \\naction taken by the richest countries. The United \\nKingdom stands ready to play its part. This year, our \\nclimate change bill will be enacted into law in the next \\nsession of Parliament to place on a statutory footing \\nour commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 \\nper cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we \\nneed similar binding commitments from all rich \\ncountries. \\n The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis \\nresolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, a new trade deal, climate \\nchange   they call for all our resources. Military \\nintervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes \\na solution cannot be found without armed force. \\nDevelopment budgets are necessary, but the developing \\nworld needs a growth plan, not just an aid plan. \\nDiplomacy needs to bridge differences between \\nnations, but also to reach out to civil society and \\nbusiness. \\n The United Kingdom is proud not just of its \\nbilateral relations with the countries represented in the \\nAssembly, but also of its commitment to multilateral \\ninstitutions, which can be a force for good in the world. \\nBut international institutions need to reflect the world \\nas it is, not the world as it was. The United Kingdom \\ntherefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental \\nnegotiations at this session to achieve agreement on \\nreform of the Security Council. We support permanent \\nmembership for Germany, Japan, India and Brazil and \\npermanent representation for Africa. We are not \\nwedded to a single model of reform. Achieving \\neffective change is what matters. \\n In a world where more than a billion people are \\nonline, where companies have bigger turnovers than \\ncountries and where global non-governmental \\norganizations have memberships that are bigger than \\nnational populations, our international institutions must \\nlook inwards to internal reform, but also outwards to \\nbroader popular movements for change. \\n In the last phase of globalization, in the \\nnineteenth century, the emergence of new Powers and \\nthe breakdown of the international order resulted in \\nconflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. \\nUnless we can build trust and reciprocity between \\nnations and embody them in durable and robust \\ninternational institutions that reconcile differences and \\nnurture common values, the latest phase of \\nglobalization could be another false dawn. \\n Globalization is not just something to which we \\nmust adapt; it is something that we can and must shape \\nfor the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to \\nuse spreading power, wealth and opportunity. For my \\nGovernment, this mission is driven by both moral \\npurpose and national interest. We must address the \\ninsecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders \\nif we are to enhance security and prosperity within our \\nborders. \\n We live in a more prosperous, more peaceful and \\nmore democratic world than ever before. Let us \\ncommit ourselves to living in a more equal world. \\n   \n",

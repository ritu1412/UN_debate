        "text": "Speaking for the first time from this rostrum, I wish to\nreaffirm here the importance France attaches to the\nmultilateral system. Our common future cannot be\nenvisaged without strengthening it.\nThe declaration adopted the day before yesterday\nis a milestone in that direction, even if it does not meet\nall our expectations. Indeed, the text makes some\nsignificant advances. I am thinking in particular of\ninnovative financing for development. I am also\nthinking of the decision to establish a peacebuilding\ncommission within the Security Council. Finally, I am\nthinking of the establishment of a Human Rights\nCouncil and the endorsement of the principle of the\nresponsibility to protect. Now it is up to us to put those\nnew concepts into practice.\nIn that connection, I wish to pay tribute here to\nthe remarkable work that has been done under the\nstewardship of Mr. Jean Ping.\nBut let us not underestimate the extent of the task\nthat still remains to be accomplished, be it in the areas\nof counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, Security\nCouncil reform or development assistance.\nThe United Nations is founded on the rule of law\nand the promotion of universal standards. Those reflect\nour common values and our conviction that there can\nbe no security and development without scrupulous\nrespect for human rights. This is not a moral question\nbut one of respect for the identity of every individual.\nIt is not a matter of passing judgement but of enabling\nall people to live in greater freedom and in dignity.\nLet us reject the impressment of children in\narmed conflicts, the systematic use of sexual violence\nagainst women and girls as a weapon of war, the\nrecourse to threats, arbitrary detention and torture of\nopponents, journalists, labour leaders and defenders of\nhuman rights. And, let us conclude the negotiations on\na convention against forced disappearances. To that\nend, let us strengthen the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and promptly\nestablish the Human Rights Council.\nFrance particularly welcomes the fact that the\ninternational community now has the necessary\nlegitimacy to exercise effectively its responsibility to\nprotect populations threatened by ethnic cleansing,\ncrimes against humanity and genocide. France also\nwelcomes the progress of the international criminal\njustice system, in particular through the action of the\nSecurity Council. Those who believe they can count on\nthe international community not to act when they\ncommit their crimes should make no mistake: they will\nbe held accountable.\nSixty years after the founding of the United\nNations, terrorism is now at the top of the list of human\nrights violations. Nothing \u2014 no cause, religion or\nmoral order \u2014 can justify attacks on the lives of\ninnocents, the lives of civilians. We must define acts of\nterrorism once and for all so that we can better combat\nthat barbaric practice which sets humankind back.\n17\n\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nconstitutes another major threat for the planet, against\nwhich we must remain united and determined.\nFrance, together with its British and German\npartners, has proposed to Iran a constructive approach\npaving the way for a new relationship between that\ngreat country and the international community. That\nrelationship is currently compromised by concerns over\nIran\u2019s nuclear programme. We ask Iran to build trust by\nproviding objective guarantees on the exclusively\npeaceful nature of its programme. Iran\u2019s statements\nfrom this rostrum compel the international community\nto meet its responsibilities, as referral of the matter to\nthe Security Council is on the agenda in order to\nstrengthen the authority of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency. The very integrity of the non-\nproliferation regime is at stake.\nBut let us also work to reduce the proliferation of\nsmall arms and light weapons, which fuel so many very\ndeadly conflicts.\nTo better serve peace and ensure the security of\npopulations, the Security Council has expanded its\nfield of action to the trafficking that finances conflicts\nand the impunity that protects traffickers, using, in\nparticular, sanctions and embargoes. The United\nNations is resolutely engaged on the ground, at the\nvery heart of conflicts. More than 70,000 blue\nhelmeted soldiers and police officers are now serving\nin 18 peacekeeping operations, and thousands of others\nare operating under Security Council mandates.\nThe results can be seen, for example, in Timor-\nLeste, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi,\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. But as countries emerge from\ncrisis, it is essential that they continue to benefit from\nour full attention and support. The United Nations has\nthe duty to take a central role in the transition phase\nthrough the Peacebuilding Commission.\nOther situations demand great vigilance and a\nhigh level of mobilization. Thus, in Haiti, the presence\nof strong contingents of United Nations soldiers and\npolice must lead to the strengthening of the political\nprocess by involving all peaceful forces without\nexception. Preparations for elections must be\naccelerated. Like all peoples, the Haitian people, who\nhave suffered for too long, are entitled to respect and\nfreedom.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the presence of the United\nNations Operation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the\nappointment of a High Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for the elections should also help strengthen\nimplementation of the process set out at Marcoussis\nand Pretoria.\nBut in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, as in Haiti, the determined\naction of the united international community will not\nproduce results unless all parties cooperate in good\nfaith and demonstrate their sense of responsibility. In\nAbidjan as in Bouak\u00e9, all must respect their pledged\ncommitments so that free and transparent elections can\nbe held throughout the country. No other solution is\npossible. That is why it is essential to resolutely\nsupport the electoral process that has begun, as well as\nthe demobilization, disarmament and reintegration\nprogrammes. All Ivorian parties must understand that\nthey will not block the peace efforts with impunity if\nthey take an obstructive stance, make hate speeches or\nchallenge democratic rules. The Security Council will\nmeet its responsibilities.\nThe situation in Lebanon demonstrates what can\nbe accomplished by a determined international\nmobilization, supported by the courageous will of the\npeople. Most Syrian forces have now left Lebanon.\nElections have been held. A representative Government\nhas been formed. Our Organization must continue to\nsupport the Lebanese Government\u2019s efforts to recover\nfull sovereignty and exercise its authority over the\nwhole of its territory. At the same time, we must\ncontinue to support the work of the commission of\ninquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri. We are\ndetermined to see justice done.\nAlso with respect to the Middle East, a dynamic\nof hope, which could touch all States of the region, is\nemerging following Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza.\nFrance, together with its European partners, stands\nwith the Palestinians to rebuild and develop that\nterritory so that its inhabitants can move around freely\nand have access to jobs and, quite simply, to decent\nliving conditions.\nBut we must not stop there. It is important to\nrestore political prospects for relaunching\nimplementation of the road map by, on the one hand,\nencouraging the Palestinians to redouble their efforts\non security and, on the other, encouraging the Israelis\nto take the measures necessary to stop settlement\nactivity and to comply with international law in their\n18\n\nstruggle for security. Peace can come only with the\nexistence of two peaceful and democratic States living\nside by side in peace and security.\nFinally, with respect to Iraq, France remains\nengaged so that, with the assistance of the United\nNations in particular, the Iraqi people can acquire\ndemocratic institutions with which all Iraqis can feel\nidentified. It is clear that a policy focused exclusively\non security leads to the retrenchment of a community,\nthus jeopardizing the cohesion of Iraqi society and the\ncountry\u2019s unity. In Iraq, too, the political process must\nnot exclude any representative, peaceful force, and the\npolitical process must offer Iraq the prospect of the\nrestoration of its complete sovereignty.\nIn all those crises, the Security Council has\ngradually imposed the authority of the United Nations\nin the service of international peace and security. Its\naction is legitimate, and its authority will be further\nstrengthened when we reach agreement on an\nenlargement of the Council that reflects the emergence\nof new Powers and which gives an equitable place to\nall continents.\nAt the same time, it is important to carry out the\nthorough management reforms that our Organization\nrequires. In his report entitled \u201cIn larger freedom\u201d\n(A\/59\/2005), the Secretary-General proposed elements\nof an action plan and initiated the first reforms. I pay\ntribute to his resoluteness and reaffirm France\u2019s\ndetermination to support him in his approach.\nWe all know that security and development\ncannot be separated. Five years after the Millennium\nSummit, heads of State or Government have just issued\na troubling assessment of the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThe outcome document they adopted (resolution\n60\/1) clearly sets out the priorities on which we must\ntake action. The first of those sadly remains food\nsecurity, because, as underlined by the Declaration on\nAction Against Hunger and Poverty, adopted in 2004\non the initiative of President Lula and President\nChirac, hunger remains the worst weapon of mass\ndestruction. It continues to kill several hundred million\nmen, women and children around the planet. We can\nsee it happening right now in the Sahel and southern\nAfrica. That scourge belonging to another age can and\nmust be fought.\nOf course, emergency humanitarian aid must be\nprovided to people in distress. That implies\nstrengthening the coordination of United Nations\ninterventions and, in particular, the establishment of an\ninternational humanitarian force, as proposed on\nseveral occasions by France.\nBut beyond that, it is important to provide all\nareas at risk with the technical resources for prevention\nand early warning. Above all, it is essential to create\nthe conditions for sustainable development to the\nbenefit of all. That is the aim of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, whose attainment requires\nsubstantial long-term financing. Official development\nassistance will continue to be primary for much time to\ncome. The summit\u2019s outcome document recalls the\ninternational commitments made in that regard, which\nFrance and the European Union will respect. It is\nurgent that the other developed countries make the\nsame commitments. But we know well that this will\nnot be sufficient. Additional long-term resources have\nto be found through innovative financing mechanisms.\nFrance endorses the establishment of\ninternational solidarity contributions. Over 66\ncountries have given their support to the pilot project\nto levy a tax on airline tickets, and we welcome this. In\nFebruary, France will host a ministerial conference on\nthis initiative so that it can be implemented specifically\nand promptly.\nBy devoting three of the eight Goals to health, the\nMillennium Declaration has put public health back at\nthe centre of sustainable development. In terms of its\nscope and socio-economic impact, the HIV\/AIDS\npandemic is of concern to us all. Only by working\ntogether will we be able to deal with it, through an\napproach that integrates prevention, treatment, care and\nthe medical and social vulnerability of infected\npersons. France wants to carry out this integrated\napproach with its European partners and with the\nWorld Health Organization, the Joint United Nations\nProgram on HIV\/AIDS and the Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We must do\neverything possible to achieve universal access to\ntreatment by 2010, if need be promoting greater\nflexibility of intellectual property rights as provided for\nin the Doha international trade agreements.\nThe fight against AIDS requires us all to mobilize\nour efforts. For its part, France has pledged to double\nits contribution to the Global Fund, increasing the\n19\n\namount to 300 million euros by 2007. At the same\ntime, international cooperation must take into account\nthe particular challenges faced by certain categories of\nindividuals: victims of abject poverty who are\nexcluded, young women denied the right to sexual and\nreproductive health, those with disabilities\nmarginalized by society.\nFrom the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico,\nfrom Japan to Antarctica, man is confronted today with\nan unprecedented rise in environmental threats that he\nhimself has caused. Scientific proof of the reality of\nclimate change and its human origins are irrefutable.\nAll initiatives must be compatible with the Kyoto\nProtocol; prospects must be charted for the future of\nthe multilateral climate regime after 2012. France\nwould hope to see more robust commitments,\nespecially regarding the transfer of technologies to\nemerging countries. To respond to the threat and more\neffectively mobilize energies and resources, France and\nEurope have proposed the establishment of a\nspecialized agency, based on the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme, for the purpose of\ncoordinating international action. This idea is\nmentioned in the summit\u2019s outcome document; it must\nnow be translated into reality.\nThe United Nations is commemorating its sixtieth\nanniversary this year. The world has changed\nprofoundly since 1945. Millions of men and women\nhave gained freedom and have emerged from\nunderdevelopment. Technological progress has been\nstaggering and has radically changed the life of society\nand relations among States. Challenges and threats\nhave changed; they are now worldwide and jeopardize\nhumanity itself.\nYet, we must remain optimistic. It is not too late,\ngiven that we understand what is at stake and that we\nmobilize collectively. The United Nations is\nrediscovering the way charted for it by the founding\nfathers: helping in the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nbuilding international cooperation for development and\npromoting human rights.\nWe need the United Nations more than ever; it is\nthe sole framework for universal comprehensive action\nwhich is legitimate and recognized as such by all\nStates. Let us give it our full support. France for its\npart makes this commitment.",

        "text": "I wish\nfirst of all to express my sincerest congratulations to\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you success in performing\nthis historic and humanitarian mission in the best\ninterests of humanity at large. I wish also to express\nmy appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping for his efforts in the\nframework of that same mission and goals during the\nprevious session of the Assembly.\nI come from Iraq, the cradle of civilization, a\nmeeting place for a variety of nationalities, religions,\ncreeds and political ideas. I come from a rich and\n36\n\nfertile land which has throughout its honourable past\ngiven the blood of its children, such as Al-Hussein and\nsubsequently Al-Sadr, to protect freedom and human\nrights.\nThis is a unique opportunity for me to make\nheard the strong voice of Iraq. The dictatorship that\nruled Iraq in the past tried to silence that voice by\nsowing death and destruction. Mass graves testify to\nthat. Today it is the terrorists who are trying to silence\nthat voice. I have come here to deliver to the Assembly\na message from my nation, to convey the real picture\nof the new Iraq that is emerging, the power of its\ndetermination and its profound love and feelings\ntowards all other nations.\nIraq is now dealing with various new realities.\nToday \u00f3 released from the restraints of a 35-year\ndictatorship that imposed on Iraq one political,\nsecurity, media and economic option and engendered a\nreal Calvary of suffering for its people \u00f3 Iraq is\nwitnessing a different, multifaceted reality. Throughout\nthat period of great suffering and while the world stood\nidly by, all kinds of crimes and suppression were\ncommitted against Iraqis, Iraqi wealth and resources,\nthe environment, education, the justice system, culture\nand civilization.\nWith the recent successful conclusion of our\npolitical journey - in record time and in spite of all\nthe obstacles and challenges facing it - the Iraqi\npeople can justly be proud of their country and identity\ntoday. Beginning with the elections on 30 January 2005\nand the formation of the Government on 3 May, and\ndespite all the challenges faced over the past three\nmonths, a draft constitution was written and will be\npresented to the Iraqi people for a vote on 15 October.\nThat referendum will allow the Iraqi people to express\nits will and allow it to constitutionally establish the\nrule of law and to create a State in which there is\nequality for all Iraqis.\nThe constitution will allow law and order, justice\nand equality for all Iraqis. Iraqi women will be able to\nparticipate actively in political life and will have their\nrights restored, including the same right that men have\nto pass on their nationality to their children. The\nconstitution grants religious freedom, freedom of\nspeech, and the right to federal and regional autonomy.\nWe are marching resolutely towards political\nstability and economic prosperity and regaining\nsecurity and stability. While there were 61 terrorist car\nbombings in July, that number dropped to nine in\nAugust and September. Likewise, the number of\nassassinations decreased from 225 to nine in the past\ntwo months.\nOn 9 September the Iraqi military attacked\nterrorist hubs in Talafar to restore security and stability\nthere. Our forces adhered to strict rules of conduct,\ndoing their best to protect innocent civilians in that\ntown. Feeling the force of that operation, the terrorists\nfled to commit more crimes \u00f3 this time in the brave\nand heroic city of Khadimiya, where over 160 civilians\nwere killed on 14 September.\nThe Iraqi forces continue to build, to train and to\nbe equipped so that they can take control of all internal\nsecurity matters and do not have to depend on the\nmultinational forces for their security. However, even\nthough some Iraqi cities are already prepared for it, the\ntime has not come for the Iraqi forces to be completely\nindependent. When we are ready and self-sufficient, we\nwill ask the multinational forces to leave our cities.\nThe new political life in Iraq is committed to\nfreedom of the press, freedom of expression, the\nseparation of the legislative, executive, and judiciary\npowers and the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as to\nrealize the aspirations of the Iraqi people to\ndevelopment and progress. Oil production and exports\nhave increased along with the number of employment\nopportunities, income and trade exchange for Iraqis.\nMore is being accomplished in public services and in\nhealth care and ambitious projects are under way to\nreconstruct our infrastructure, especially in the areas of\nhome and road construction. Environmental bureaux\nhave now declared the Iraqi provinces to be free from\nradioactivity.\nI therefore seize this opportunity to urge creditor\nnations to help us by cancelling Iraqi debt or loans.\nThat debt was accumulated under the corrupt policies\nof the previous regime and the Iraqi people have had\nno hand in it.\nFor Iraq to recover its role in the international\ncommunity and to participate effectively in defending\ninternational peace and security and to combat the evil\nscourge of terrorism, it must be allowed to rebuild and\nto implement plans for the development, rehabilitation\nand the rebuilding of its infrastructure. I call on the\ndonor countries to meet their commitments undertaken\nat different international conferences, including in\n37\n\nMadrid, Brussels and, most recently, Jordan, to provide\nfinancial aid to Iraq.\nIraq would like to pay tribute to the constructive\nrole of the United Nations in its special efforts to help\nthe Iraqi people through the special envoy of the\nSecretary-General and the technical election assistance\nteam. While we highly appreciate those efforts, we are\nalso looking forward to having the United Nations\nreturn to Iraq and reopen its offices and agencies in\norder to support the reconstruction and development\nprocess.\nWe also call upon the international community to\nevaluate the need to adopt an international programme\nto protect and preserve the fine cultural and\narchaeological heritage and shrines of Iraq, whose\ncities are steeped in history, from Sumer and Babylon\nto the present.\nToday, Iraq is both a witness to and a victim of\nthe cruel, vicious and merciless attacks of international\nterrorists, who began their global campaign on\n11 September 2001. Alarm bells are ringing in different\ncapitals around the world \u00f3 in Spain, Britain, Turkey,\nEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia - as we\nhave all witnessed. Iraq was afflicted with that scourge\nunder Saddam\u00eds regime, whose policy was to rule or\ndestroy people and property with all types of lethal\nweapons. Today the Iraqi people are paying the price of\ncountering terrorism, because it is their homes that are\non the frontlines of the battle. The world must support\nIraqis in fighting the war against terrorism and the\nremnants of the Baath regime so that it can move\ntowards democracy.\nIn order to deal effectively and radically with\nterrorism, we must agree on a definition of a number of\nelements that are closely related to it, including suicide\nand the culture of terrorism, the financing of terrorism,\nadvocacy and propaganda that attempt to legitimize\nterrorism, perpetrators of terrorist acts and State\nterrorism.\nNo country is free of terrorism today. Any\ncountry can be a victim of terrorism at any time. We all\nface this common threat. It brooks no boundaries; the\ngeography of terrorism envelopes all humanity. We\nmust therefore lend a hand to those who are paying the\nprice of terrorism and to its victims. Because of the\ninterdependence of nations, what happens in one\ncountry cannot fail to have repercussions in others.\nThere is also a need to draw a distinction between\nnatural disasters and terrorist disasters caused by man.\nThe former are often uncontrollable. When they occur\nthe entire world mobilizes to provide assistance to the\naffected countries, as we witnessed in the case of last\nDecember\u00eds Asian tsunami and the recent Hurricane\nKatrina in Louisiana. But the calamities of terrorism, if\nallowed, will be as devastating as natural disasters. We\nneed to raise awareness and work together to put an\nend to terrorism and to alleviate its destructive impact.\nIn this regard, we want to express our warmest\nthanks to the people of the United States and to all the\nother peoples who have supported us. We must join\nefforts to triumph over terrorism, because those who\nwin this victory will be able to help others as well. The\nIraqi people are in the forefront of the counter-\nterrorism struggle. Why do those countries that send\nsuicide bombers not send their young people to do\nhumanitarian work to contribute to the reconstruction\nof Iraq instead of sending them to kill children, to\ndestabilize Iraq and its security? Why do they not send\nfunds to invest in Iraq, so that the common interests of\nour peoples and theirs may be achieved and so that the\nstay of the multinational forces may be shortened?\nWhy do the news agencies in these countries not relay\nthe achievements of the new Iraq and convey the real\npicture of the terrorist offensive, which targets popular\nmarkets and civilian gatherings, instead of inciting\nmedia reports that distort facts and falsify realities?\nBut prior to that, we call upon neighbouring countries\nto stand by our people and prevent terrorists from\nentering Iraq, and to commit themselves to protecting\nour common borders for the safety and well-being of\nour peoples. We seek to establish the best possible\nrelations with all countries, especially neighbouring\nones, in order to promote the best interests of all and to\nsafeguard national sovereignty and protect it from any\nforeign interference.\nI would like now to touch on the most important\npolitical problems and the need for these problems to\nbe resolved peacefully in accordance with international\nagreements and treaties. We call for a fair and just\nsolution to the political problems in the Middle East,\nand in particular the Palestinian question, so that this\nregion and all regions of the world will be free from\nweapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons. We\nalso must affirm the legitimate right of the Palestinian\npeople to establish a sovereign State, ensuring them a\nlife of dignity lived in freedom in a climate of peace in\ntheir own territory. We must all work to spread the\n38\n\nculture of love, peace and coexistence instead of the\nculture of hatred, war, vindictiveness and terrorism.\nIraq, whose children aspire to political,\neconomic, security and developmental reconstruction,\nwants fully to assume its responsibility, both regional\nand international, to safeguard peace and security\nthroughout the region and in the world. Iraq pays\ntribute to the United Nations, which has provided the\nworld with a broad umbrella to prevent wars and\nresolve conflicts. The world today is constantly\nchanging, and this requires dynamic changes in the\nstructure, decision-making and working methods of the\nUnited Nations so it can cope with new world realities\nand meet its obligations. Iraq is undergoing difficult\ntimes, but its aspirations are just and we therefore hope\nthat you will give Iraq your support and that you will\ndisplay solidarity with Iraq, especially as we are on the\nverge of adopting our permanent constitution, a\nconstitution that can ensure independence and a life of\ndemocracy, coexistence, love and tolerance for all.",

        "text": "Today, we have\ngathered here to exchange views about the world, its\nfuture and our common responsibilities towards it. It is\nobvious that the future of the world is intertwined with\nits current state and with the prevailing trends, which\nexhibit signs of hope and despair.\nOn the one hand, certain hopes and opportunities\nexist, and the General Assembly is convened on the\nbasis of those hopes. Today, human thought reflects\nsignificant commonalities that provide an appropriate\nfoundation upon which to build. With the passing of\nthe era of agnostic philosophies, humanity is once\nagain united in celebrating monotheism and belief in\nthe Creator as the originator of existence. That is the\ncommon thread that binds us all together. Faith will\nprove to be the solution to many of today\u00eds problems.\nThe truth will shine the light of faith and ethics on the\nlives of human beings; it will prevent them from\nengaging in aggression, coercion and injustice; and it\nwill guide them towards care and compassion for\nfellow beings.\nAnother hope is found in the common global\nappreciation of the sources of knowledge. Although\nreason, experience and science are among the valuable\nsources of knowledge, the darkness of the Middle Ages\nprevented major portions of the Western world from\nappreciating them. This reactionary tendency deprived\nmany of access to various scientific findings and\nknowledge and led to the exclusion of other sources of\nknowledge, namely God and knowledge based on\nrevelation from the life of human beings in the West \u00f3\ndivine knowledge that was disseminated by such\nprophets as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and\n5\n\nMohammad. Today, agnostic thinking is on the decline\nand humanity is equally enamoured of religion,\nscience, knowledge and spirituality. This is an\nauspicious beginning.\nDivine prophets teach us about proper regard for\nthe exalted state of human beings on earth. The human\nbeing is blessed with dignity, manifested most\nimportantly in being the viceroy of the Almighty on\nearth. The Almighty placed humans on earth to develop\nit, to institutionalize justice, to overcome their egoistic\ntendencies and to praise no lord but the Almighty.\nFaith and good deeds can bring deliverance and the\ngood life, even in this world. Attaining this depend on\nhuman will, that is, the will of each and every one of\nus. We must heed the call of our common primordial\nnature and achieve the realization of this good life.\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of military\ndomination; increasing poverty; the growing gap\nbetween rich and poor countries; violence as a means\nto resolve crises; the spread of terrorism, especially\nState terrorism; the existence and proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction; the pervasive lack of\nhonesty in inter-State relations; and disregard for the\nequal rights of peoples and nations in international\nrelations constitute some of the challenges and threats\nfacing us.\nAlthough these challenges are very real, we\nbelieve we are not predestined to experience them. Our\ncommon will not only can change this course but, in\nfact, can lead us to a life filled with hope and\nprosperity. Divine revelation teaches us that\n'The Almighty changes the fate of no people\nunless they themselves show a will for change'\n(The Holy Koran, XIII:11).\nHow can we influence the future of the world?\nWhen and how will peace, tranquillity and well-being\nfor all come about? These are the fundamental\nquestions before us.\nWe believe that a sustainable order - in which\npeace and tranquillity can flourish - can be realized\nonly on the basis of the two pillars of justice and\nspirituality. The more human society departs from\njustice and spirituality, the greater the insecurity it will\nface, so much so that a relatively small crisis - such\nas a natural disaster - can lead to various aberrations\nand inhumane behaviour.\nUnfortunately, the world is rife with\ndiscrimination and poverty. Discrimination produces\nhatred, war and terrorism. They all share the common\nroot of a lack of spirituality coupled with injustice.\nJustice is about equal rights; the equitable\ndistribution of resources in the territories of different\nStates; the equality of all before the law; and respect\nfor international agreements. Justice recognizes the\nright of all to tranquillity, peace and a dignified life.\nJustice rejects intimidation and double standards. As\nthe eminent daughter of the Prophet of Islam said,\n'Justice brings tranquillity to our hearts.'\nToday, the world longs for the establishment of\nsuch justice. If humanity heeds the call of its\nprimordial nature with firm resolve, justice will follow.\nThat is what the Almighty has promised and what all\npeople of goodwill from all religions are waiting for. If\nthe prevailing discourse of global relations becomes\none of justice and spirituality, then durable peace will\nbe guaranteed.\nConversely, if international relations are defined\nwithout justice or spirituality and are void of moral\nconsiderations, then mechanisms for promoting\nconfidence and peace will remain insufficient and\nineffective.\nIf some, relying on their superior military and\neconomic might, attempt to expand their rights and\nprivileges, they will be performing a great disservice to\nthe cause of peace and, in fact, will fuel the arms race\nand spread insecurity, fear and deception. If global\ntrends continue to serve the interests of small,\ninfluential groups, even the interests of the citizens of\npowerful countries will be jeopardized, as was seen\nduring recent crises and natural disasters such as the\nrecent tragedy of Hurricane Katrina.\nToday my nation calls on other nations and\nGovernments to move forward towards a durable\ntranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran was born of a\nmovement based on the pure, primordial nature of a\npeople who rose up to regain their dignity, esteem and\nhuman rights. The Islamic revolution toppled a regime\nwhich had been put in place through a coup and that\nwas being supported by those who claim to be\nadvocates of democracy and human rights. For 25\nyears they thwarted the aspirations of the nation to\ndevelopment and progress through the intimidation and\n6\n\ntorture of the population and submission and\nsubservience to outsiders.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is the manifestation\nof true democracy in the region. The discourse of the\nIranian nation is focused on respect for the rights of\nhuman beings and on a quest for tranquillity, peace,\njustice and development for all through monotheism.\nFor eight years, Saddam's regime imposed a\nmassive war of aggression and occupation on my\npeople. It employed the most heinous weapons of mass\ndestruction - including chemical weapons - against\nIranians and Iraqis alike. But who, in fact, armed\nSaddam with those weapons? What was the reaction of\nthose who now claim to fight against weapons of mass\ndestruction to the use of chemical weapons back then?\nThe world is witness to the fact that the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, because of its humanitarian\nprinciples - even during the most trying of times and\nwhen it was sustaining the highest number of\ncasualties - never allowed itself to use such weapons.\nThousands of nuclear warheads stockpiled in various\nlocations, coupled with programmes to further develop\nthese inhuman weapons, have created a new\natmosphere of repression and the rule of the machines\nof war, threatening the international community and\neven the citizens of the countries that possess them.\nIronically, those that have actually used nuclear\nweapons and continue to produce, stockpile and\nextensively test such weapons; that have used depleted\nuranium bombs and bullets against tens, perhaps\nhundreds, of thousands of Iraqis and Kuwaitis, and\neven their own soldiers and those of their allies,\nafflicting them with incurable diseases; that blatantly\nviolate their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); that have\nrefrained from signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT); and that have armed the\nZionist occupation regime with weapons of mass\ndestruction \u00f3 they are not only refusing to remedy\ntheir past actions, but, in clear breach of the NPT, are\ntrying to prevent other countries from acquiring the\ntechnology necessary to produce nuclear energy for\npeaceful purposes.\nAll of these problems emanate from the fact that\nthe elements of justice and spirituality are missing in\nthe way powerful Governments conduct their affairs\nwith other nations.\nAfter 11 September, a particular radical group\nwas accused of terrorist activities, although it was\nnever explained how such huge intelligence-gathering\nand security organizations had failed to prevent such\nan extensive and well-planned operation.\nWhy have Powers that not so long ago were\nsupporting the activities of such groups in Afghanistan,\nthereby portraying themselves as supporters of human\nrights and of the Afghan people, overnight turned into\ntheir most fierce critics? Are we to believe that their\nbenefactors - those very same hegemonic Powers -\nhave lost control? If so, would it not be better for those\nPowers to adopt an honest and transparent approach to\nthe international community, provide precise\ninformation about the main elements and their weapons\nand financial support system, and accept responsibility\nfor their inhuman actions against nations and countries,\nthereby assisting peoples and nations in addressing the\nroots of terrorism correctly, wisely and sincerely?\nWe must endeavour to achieve sustainable\ntranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.\nTerrorism and weapons of mass destruction are\ntwo major threats facing the international community.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as one of the main\nvictims of terrorism and chemical weapons, fully\nappreciates the difficulties involved in combating these\nmenaces. Today, the most serious challenge is that the\nculprits are assuming the role of the prosecutor. Even\nmore dangerous is that certain parties, relying on their\npower and wealth, are trying to impose a climate of\nintimidation and injustice on the world. They are\nbullying others, while using their huge media resources\nto portray themselves as defenders of freedom,\ndemocracy and human rights.\nPeople around the world are fully aware of what\nis happening in occupied Palestine. Women and\nchildren are being murdered and teenagers are being\ntaken prisoner. Houses are being demolished and farms\nare being burned down. Yet when the people of\nPalestine resist these conditions, they are accused of\nterrorism. At the same time, the occupier, which does\nnot abide by any principles, terror being part of its\nstated and regular policy, enjoys the support of the\npreviously mentioned Governments. Let me be still\nmore blunt. State terrorism is being supported by those\nwho claim to fight terrorism.\nHow can one talk about human rights and at the\nsame time blatantly deny many people the inalienable\n7\n\nright of access to science and technology, which have\napplications in the fields of medicine, industrial\nproduction and energy, and hinder their progress and\ndevelopment by means of force and intimidation? Can\nnations be deprived of scientific and technological\nprogress through the threat of use of force and on the\nbasis of mere allegations of possible military\ndiversion? We believe that all countries and nations are\nentitled to technological and scientific advancement in\nall fields, and particularly to the peaceful technology to\nproduce nuclear fuel. Such access cannot be restricted\nto a few, depriving most nations and thereby\nestablishing economic monopolies which are then used\nas an instrument to expand domination.\nWe have gathered here to defend human rights in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and\nto prevent certain Powers from claiming that some\ncountries have more rights or that some countries do\nnot have the right to enjoy their legitimate rights.\nWe must not, at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury, revert to the logic of the Dark Ages and try\nonce again to deny societies access to scientific and\ntechnological advances. The United Nations must be\nthe symbol of democracy and of the equal rights of\nnations. If we talk about the equal rights of nations in\npolitical forums, we must talk of the same concept in\nthis forum as well. Similarly, if we talk about the right\nof sovereignty, then all nations must be allowed to\nexercise their rights on an equal footing and in a\ndemocratic process.\nThe United Nations will be able to be the\nstandard-bearer of democracy in the world when it,\nitself, is a manifestation of democratic process. I\nreiterate that sustainable tranquillity and peace can\nonly be built on justice and spirituality.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is a symbol of true\ndemocracy. All officials, including the Leader,\nPresident and members of the Islamic Consultative\nAssembly, city and village councils are elected through\nthe vote of the citizens. The Islamic Republic of Iran\nhas held 27 national elections in 27 years. This\nshowcases a vibrant and dynamic society in which\npeople participate broadly in political life.\nBecause of its key importance and influence in\nthe important and strategic Middle East region, the\nIslamic Republic of Iran is committed to contributing\nactively to the promotion of peace and stability in that\nregion.\nThe Saddam and the Taliban regimes were both\nthe products of foreign Powers. The people of\nAfghanistan and of Iraq know very well who supported\nthose two regimes. Today, to establish peace and\nsecurity in the region, foreign occupation forces must\nleave and completely hand over the political and\neconomic sovereignty of those two countries to their\npeoples.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to\nprovide full and comprehensive support to the people\nof Iraq and Afghanistan and to their elected\nGovernments and will actively help them establish\norder and security. My country will continue to expand\nits sincere cooperation and interaction with them.\nIn Palestine, a sustainable peace will be possible\nthrough justice, an end to discrimination, an end to the\noccupation of Palestinian land, the return of all\nPalestinian refugees and the establishment of a\ndemocratic Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as\nits capital.\nToday, more than ever, nations need constructive,\npositive and honest cooperation and interaction in\norder to enjoy a dignified, tranquil and peaceful life\nbased on justice and spirituality. Let us enter into a\ncollective covenant to realize this legitimate aspiration\nof our nations.\nHere, I should like to talk briefly about the\napproach and initiative of the Islamic Republic of Iran\non the nuclear issue. Nuclear weapons and their\nproliferation, on the one hand, and attempts to impose\nan apartheid regime on access to peaceful nuclear\nenergy, on the other, are two major threats to\ninternational tranquillity and peace.\nKeeping in mind that in past years no serious\nefforts complemented by practical mechanisms have\nbeen made to move towards full disarmament and,\nmore specifically, to implement the decisions and\noutcomes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) review conferences of 1995\nand 2000, I suggest that the General Assembly, as the\nmost inclusive United Nations organ, mandate an ad\nhoc committee to compile and submit a comprehensive\nreport on possible practical mechanisms and strategies\nfor complete disarmament. Such a committee should\nalso be asked to investigate how, in violation of the\nNPT, material, technology and equipment for nuclear\nweapons were transferred to the Zionist regime, and to\npropose practical measures for the establishment of a\n8\n\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Some\npowerful States practise a discriminatory approach\nagainst access by NPT States parties to material,\nequipment, and peaceful nuclear technology. In doing\nso, they intend to impose a nuclear apartheid. We are\nconcerned that once certain powerful States completely\ncontrol nuclear energy resources and technology, they\nwill deny access to other States and thus deepen the\ndivide between powerful countries and the rest of the\ninternational community. When that happens, we shall\nbe divided into light and dark countries.\nRegrettably, in the past 30 years, no effective\nmeasure has been implemented to facilitate the\nexercise of the legally recognized right of NPT States\nparties to have access to and to use peaceful nuclear\nenergy in accordance with article IV. Therefore, the\nGeneral Assembly should ask the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency - in accordance with article II of its\nStatute - to report on violations by specific countries\nthat have hindered the implementation of the above\narticle and also to produce practical strategies for its\nrenewed implementation.\nIt is particularly important to note that the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy without possession of\nthe nuclear fuel cycle is an empty proposition.\nCountries and peoples that rely for their fuel on\ncoercive powers and stop at nothing to further their\ninterests may indeed become totally dependent on\nnuclear power plants. No popularly elected,\nresponsible Government would consider such a\nsituation to be in the interest of its people. The history\nof dependence on oil in oil-rich countries under\ndomination is an experience that no independent\ncountry would be willing to repeat.\nThose hegemonic Powers that consider the\nscientific and technological progress of independent\nand free nations to be a challenge to their monopoly on\nthose important instruments of power and which do not\nwant to see such achievements in other countries, have\nmisrepresented Iran\u00eds healthy and fully safeguarded\ntechnological endeavours in the nuclear field as a\npursuit of nuclear weapons. That is nothing but a\npropaganda ploy. The Islamic Republic of Iran is\npresenting in good faith its proposal for constructive\ninteraction and a just dialogue. However, if some try to\nimpose their will on the Iranian people by resorting to\na language of force and threats against Iran, we will\nreconsider our entire approach to the nuclear issue.\nAllow me, as the elected President of the Iranian\npeople, to outline the other main elements of my\ncountry\u00eds initiative regarding the nuclear issue.\nFirst, the Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms its\npreviously and repeatedly stated position that, in\naccordance with our religious principles, the pursuit of\nnuclear weapons is prohibited.\nSecondly, the Islamic Republic of Iran believes\nthat it is necessary to revitalize the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and, as I\nproposed earlier, to create an ad hoc committee to\ncombat nuclear weapons and abolish the apartheid that\nexists in the field of peaceful nuclear technology.\nThirdly, the fuel cycle of the Islamic Republic of\nIran is not technically different from that of other\ncountries that have peaceful nuclear technology.\nTherefore, as a further confidence-building measure\nand in order to provide the greatest degree of\ntransparency, the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared\nto engage in serious partnerships with the private and\npublic sectors of other countries in the implementation\nof a uranium enrichment programme in Iran. That\nrepresents the most far-reaching step - beyond all\nrequirements of the NPT - proposed by Iran as a\nfurther confidence-building measure.\nFourthly, in keeping with Iran\u00eds inalienable right\nto have access to a nuclear fuel cycle, continued\ninteraction and technical and legal cooperation with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency will be the\ncentrepiece of our nuclear policy. The initiation and the\ncontinuation of negotiations with other countries will\nbe carried out in the context of Iran\u00eds interaction with\nthe Agency. With that in mind, I have directed the\nrelevant Iranian officials to compile the legal and\ntechnical details of Iran\u00eds nuclear approach, based on\nthe following considerations.\nFirst, international precedent tells us that nuclear\nfuel delivery contracts are unreliable, and no legally\nbinding international document or instrument exists to\nguarantee the delivery of nuclear fuel. On many\noccasions such bilateral contracts have either been\nsuspended or stopped altogether for political reasons.\nTherefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in its pursuit\nof peaceful nuclear technology, considers it to be\nwithin its legitimate rights to receive objective\nguarantees for uranium enrichment in the nuclear fuel\ncycle.\n9\n\nSecondly, in its negotiations with the European\nUnion three, Iran has tried in earnest to demonstrate\nthe solid and legitimate foundations of its nuclear\nactivity in the context of the NPT and to establish\nmutual trust. The selection of our negotiating partners\nand the continuation of negotiations with the European\nUnion three will be commensurate with the\nrequirements of our cooperation with the Agency\nregarding the non-diversion of the process of uranium\nenrichment to non-peaceful purposes, within the\nframework of the NPT. In that context, several\nproposals have been presented that can be considered\nin the context of the negotiations.\nThirdly, the discriminatory approach with respect\nto the NPT, focusing on the obligations of States\nparties while disregarding their rights under the Treaty,\nshould cease.\nAs the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I\nassure the Assembly that my country will do\neverything in its power to contribute to global\ntranquillity and peace, based on the two values of\nspirituality and justice, and on the principle of equal\nrights of all peoples and nations. My country will\ninteract and cooperate constructively with the\ninternational community to face the challenges before\nus.\nFrom the beginning of time, humanity has longed\nfor the day when justice, peace, equality and\ncompassion would envelop the world. All of us can\ncontribute to the establishment of such a world. When\nthat day comes, the ultimate promise of all divine\nreligions will be fulfilled with the emergence of a\nperfect human being who is heir to all prophets and\npious men. He will lead the world to justice and\nabsolute peace.\nAlmighty Lord, I pray to you to hasten the\nappearance of your last repository - the promised one,\nthat perfect and pure human being, the one who will\nfill this world with justice and peace. O Lord, include\nus among his companions, followers and those who\nserve his cause.",

        "text": "May I begin by extending my congratulations on your\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its\nsixtieth session. I am confident that under your\nguidance this session will achieve fruitful results. I also\nwish to take this opportunity to express my sincere\nrespects to Mr. Jean Ping, President at the previous\nsession, and to the Secretary-General.\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the\nend of the world war against fascism and the founding\nof the United Nations. Just a few days ago in this Hall,\nworld leaders solemnly adopted the outcome document\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60\/1).\nNow, it falls to us to fulfil the important and pressing\ntask of working towards a harmonious world of lasting\npeace and common prosperity by translating that\ndocument into action and turning fine words into\nreality. This session should serve to promote peace,\nharmony and common development.\nWe want peaceful development. Progress of\nmankind needs a peaceful environment. Stability and\nsecurity of one country cannot be built on the\nturbulence or crisis of another. Only a new security\nconcept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality\nand coordination will enable us to develop in peace and\nsafeguard peace through development.\nWe want harmonious development. To build a\nbetter future is the long-cherished dream of mankind.\nAny development strategy should be guided by a long-\nterm and holistic perspective instead of immediate and\nsectoral benefits. Therefore, we should work together\nfor more democratic and law-based international\nrelations and a harmonious environment in which\ncountries respect one another, treat one another as\nequals, and in which different cultures can emulate and\ninterchange with each other.\n18\n\nWe want common development. No model of\ndevelopment that benefits only a few countries or a\nsmall group of people is acceptable or sustainable.\nCountries should cooperate with each other more\nclosely so that economic globalization may yield\nsuccessful results, benefit-sharing and common\nprosperity.\nThis session should serve to push forward\nreforms of the United Nations and strengthen its role.\nHaving weathered 60 years of vicissitudes, the United\nNations needs multifaceted and multidimensional\nreforms so as to be able to make a greater contribution\nto mankind\u2019s noble cause of peace and development.\nThe position of the United Nations as the core of\nthe world collective security mechanism must be\nstrengthened so that it can perform its duty of\nsafeguarding peace in a more effective way. China\nsupports the efforts to enhance the Organization\u2019s\ncapacity on conflict prevention, mediation and good\noffices. We also favour a greater role by the Secretary-\nGeneral in this respect and the fostering of a preventive\nculture.\nWe support the efforts to strengthen United\nNations peacekeeping operations, particularly with\nregard to rapid deployment capacity and strategic\npreparedness, as well as the capacity to fully mobilize\nregional organizations and their resources under the\nleadership of the Security Council.\nChina supports the establishment of a\nPeacebuilding Commission to more effectively\ncoordinate United Nations efforts in the areas of\npeacekeeping, post-conflict rehabilitation and\ndevelopment. In that respect, the Economic and Social\nCouncil and other development assistance agencies\nshould have an important role to play in the\nCommission.\nIt has been our consistent position to oppose the\nuse or threat of force in international relations. We do\nnot support the reinterpretation or revision of the\nprovisions in the Charter of the United Nations related\nto the right of self-defence. Should an occasion arise\nthat calls for the use of force, it is the Security Council\nthat should make sound judgements and take prudent\ndecisions as to the merits of the situation.\nThe international community should continue to\npress ahead with the international process on arms\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation; safeguard\nand enhance the authority and effectiveness of existing\nmultilateral treaties; give full scope to the role of the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations in\nthe area of non-proliferation; and seek solutions to\nrelated issues by political and diplomatic means.\nThe United Nations should be able to cope more\neffectively with non-traditional security threats. We\nwelcome the comprehensive strategy on counter-\nterrorism proposed by the Secretary-General, and we\nhope to see the early conclusion of a comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, taking full\naccount of the concerns of various parties, particularly\ndeveloping countries.\nIn the effort to reduce and prevent large-scale\nhumanitarian crises, the international community\nshould strictly observe the United Nations Charter,\nrespect the opinions of the countries or organizations\nconcerned and, with the Security Council\u2019s\nauthorization, explore, to the greatest extent possible,\npeaceful settlement within the United Nations\nframework. We oppose any rash intervention carried\nout on the basis of the claim that a nation is unable or\nunwilling to protect its own citizens.\nDevelopment should be a main focus of United\nNations reform. Although China is a low-income\ndeveloping country, it is prepared to contribute as\nmuch as it can to international cooperation for\ndevelopment. As President Hu Jintao announced at the\nsummit, China will take substantive steps in five areas.\nWe will join hands with all Members to advance\nreforms in the area of development so as to facilitate\nthe resolution of development issues. The United\nNations should put in place a fair and rational\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) review\nframework to assess progress made in various\ncountries and to monitor follow-up of international\ncooperation and aid commitments. We support the\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council\nin development-related areas.\nThe Doha Round should embody development in\nits focus, paying more attention and taking actions to\naddress the concerns of developing countries,\nparticularly with regard to agricultural produce and\nspecial and differential treatment. China has decided to\ngrant zero-tariff treatment to some commodities from\n39 least developed countries, which will cover the\nmajority of China\u2019s imports from those countries.\n19\n\nChina is in favour of incorporating the prevention\nand treatment of HIV\/AIDS and the building of the\npublic health sector into the development programmes\nand activities of various countries and of the United\nNations. We will be submitting at the current session a\ndraft resolution on strengthening global capacity-\nbuilding in the area of public health. In the next three\nyears, we plan to provide more aid and medicine to\ndeveloping countries for preventing and treating\nmalaria and other communicable diseases and to help\nthem establish and reform their public health systems\nand train medical personnel.\nThe international community \u2014 particularly\ndeveloped countries \u2014 should take substantive steps to\nhelp developing countries break the vicious circle of\ndebt. Such steps include substantial debt reduction and\nthe streamlining of debt relief procedures and\nrequirements. In the next two years, China will write\noff or otherwise cancel the overdue portions, as of the\nend of 2004, of interest-free or low-interest\nGovernment loans owed by all heavily indebted poor\ncountries having diplomatic relations with China.\nWe call on the United Nations to give priority to\nhelping developing countries to strengthen their\ncapacity-building. China will help developing\ncountries train 30,000 people for various professions in\nthe next three years.\nMy country also favours setting a timetable for\ndeveloped countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their\ngross national income to official development\nassistance. New fund-raising methods should be\nexplored so as to put more funds into development.\nChina pledges $10 billion in concessional loans\nto developing countries in the next three years within\nthe framework of South-South cooperation.\nThe Charter of the United Nations grants the\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A\nhighly efficient, responsible and representative Council\nserves the long-term interests of the United Nations\nand the common interests of all its Member States.\nChina supports reform of the Security Council\naimed at strengthening its authority and efficiency and\nimproving its working methods. The representation of\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\nshould be increased so that small and medium-sized\ncountries would have more say in the Council\u2019s\ndecision-making. No reform proposal can work that\naddresses only the concerns of a few countries,\ndisregarding the interests of the majority of countries,\nand treats developing countries in Africa and in other\nparts of the world unfairly.\nChina supports the principle of cooperation based\non democratic consultation. As reform will affect the\nfuture of the United Nations and the interests of\nvarious parties, there should be no artificial timeframes\nor attempts to force decisions through a vote. Instead,\nMember States should seek consensus through dialogue\nand consultation and in accordance with the principle\nof democratic international relations.\nChina embraces the spirit of unity and\ncooperation. The United Nations family has 191\nMembers. Unity is the source of strength. We want\nunity, not division. As long as Member States respect\none another\u2019s interests, accommodate one another\u2019s\nconcerns and show pragmatism and flexibility, we will\nbe able to find a reform path that is acceptable to all.\nThe current session should focus on Africa.\nAfrican countries make up a quarter of the United\nNations membership, and their populations account for\n13 per cent of the world\u2019s total population. If there is\nno stability in Africa, the world will have no peace. If\nAfrica remains poor, there will be no development for\nthe world. The outcome document of the summit calls\nfor efforts to meet the special needs of Africa. I believe\nthat that is correct and necessary.\nDespite the gratifying progress made in Africa in\nrecent years, conflicts in some of its regions have\npersisted. The Security Council should pay special\nattention to African problems and give them priority on\nits agenda. That means not only devoting more Council\nmeetings to African issues, but also, and more\nimportant, taking concrete actions to heed Africa\u2019s\nvoice, respect its views and accommodate its concerns.\nChina applauds the mediation and good offices of\nthe African Union and other regional organizations\naimed at conflict settlement in Africa. We support\nclose cooperation between the Security Council and\nthose organizations by providing them with funds,\nlogistics and technical assistance to strengthen their\npeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction\ncapacities.\nAfrican countries face difficulties in the area of\ndevelopment, particularly in attaining the MDGs. More\n20\n\nthan 300 million people are still living under the\npoverty line. One third of all children are\nmalnourished. More than 30 million people are\nsuffering from HIV\/AIDS. With less than 2 per cent of\nthe world\u2019s economic aggregate, Africa is weighed\ndown by debts amounting to $300 billion. All of that\nposes a challenge to the conscience of mankind.\nThe international community should reach a\nglobal consensus on African development and help the\ncontinent to achieve the MDGs on schedule by\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment. Those who provide assistance must do\nso in all sincerity and respect the right of African\ncountries to make their own decisions. Assistance must\nalso have a clear aim: to meet the basic and long-term\nneeds of the African people. Assistance is by no means\ncharity or a gift; it is a response to the call for mutual\nbenefit and common development. Furthermore, it is\nour moral duty to help the needy and redress injustices.\nIn the twentieth century, Africa shook off\ncolonial rule and achieved national liberation. That was\nan epoch-making event. The twenty-first century will\nbring peace and development to Africa \u2014 it is\nhistorically inevitable. The Chinese people will\ncontinue to stand beside their African brothers and\nsisters on that journey of historic significance.\nThe recently concluded Six-Party Talks in Beijing\non the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have reached an\nimportant consensus and issued a joint declaration,\nmarking an important step forward in the Talks and a\ncrystallization of the political will and diligence of the\nparties concerned. It also reflects the common\naspiration of the international community. Because it\nwas so hard-won, this result needs to be especially\nprized. We hope that the parties will continue to work\ntogether to promote further progress in the Six-Party\nTalks, resolve the nuclear issue on the Peninsula\nthrough dialogue and by peaceful means, ensure lasting\npeace and stability in the region and realize its\ncommon goals for development and prosperity. The\nChinese Government will continue to make a positive\ncontribution in that regard.",

        "text": "Your election, Sir, as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtieth\nsession comes at a significant moment in the history of\nthe United Nations. The outcome document adopted by\nour heads of State or Government shortly after the\nbeginning of the session represents the culmination of\na long process. It started with the report of the High-\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. It\ncontinued with the Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cIn larger\nfreedom\u201d report, and the efforts of your distinguished\npredecessor to synthesize those ideas for the\nconsideration of Member States. We thank all of those\ninvolved for their dedicated efforts.\nWe are united in our commitment to\nmultilateralism; that is a good foundation for our\nfurther efforts. All countries, especially those from the\ndeveloping world, played a significant role in the\nnegotiations on the outcome document. Much was\nachieved; much has been left out. There are\nfoundations on which we have to build, but there are\nalso shortcomings which we need to correct in the\nprocess of implementation. A notable omission is the\ntheme of disarmament. Our struggle for multilaterally\nnegotiated, universal and verifiable nuclear\ndisarmament, in a time-bound manner, must continue\nwith vigour. The outcome document must serve as a\nroad map, with its main elements acting as signposts in\nour discussions over the coming months under your\nstewardship, Mr. President.\n26\n\nYou, Sir, have suggested a very appropriate theme\nfor the general debate: \u201cFor a stronger and more\neffective United Nations: follow-up to and\nimplementation of the High-Level Meeting in\nSeptember 2005\u201d. We believe that that captures the\nspirit and essence of all that we, co-partners in the\nUnited Nations, wish to achieve.\nIndia is the world\u2019s largest democracy. There is\nno historical precedent for a democracy of over 1\nbillion people. It is a tremendous undertaking. It is also\nan exciting and inspiring one. We are breaking new\nground. The fact that Indian democracy works is a\npolitical miracle. The credit goes to the Indian voters.\nThey ensure that India remains secular, democratic and\npluralistic.\nWe also believe that we need to do much more to\ninculcate respect for and acceptance of pluralism. I am\nreminded of what Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our\nnation, said:\n\u201cI do not want my house to be walled in on all\nsides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the\ncultures of all the lands to be blown about my\nhouse as freely as possible. But I refuse to be\nblown off my feet by any.\u201d\nHumankind is now learning, to some extent, to\ncope with the menace of terrorism. We all know that\nthat evil is increasingly directed at innocent civilians.\nIt invites the strongest condemnation. We all agree that\nthere can be no justification for terrorism in any form.\nWhether we are considering terrorism or non-\nproliferation, unless there is a non-selective, uniform\nand sustained approach, the objectives of the\ninternational community cannot be achieved. The\noutcome document reflects the joint resolve of the\ninternational community to fight terrorism. In our\njudgement, there is no institutional setting that is more\ncapable than the United Nations of providing cohesion\nand vigour to those efforts.\nAs a victim of terrorism over the past two\ndecades, India understands, and is fully supportive of,\nthe need for United Nations action on counter-\nterrorism. A key aspect of the implementation of the\noutcome document will be the development and\nadoption by the General Assembly of a strong counter-\nterrorism agenda to supplement the existing General\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions on that\nissue. As an initiator of the draft comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, India welcomes,\nand is fully committed to, the decision taken by heads\nof State or Government to conclude negotiations on the\nconvention during this session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe main purpose of the summit last week was to\nreview the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration. Unfortunately, most developing countries\nwill not be able to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, given current growth rates and\nlevels of international support. We must strengthen\nefforts at both the national and the international levels\nto take us closer to the development targets set out in\nthe Millennium document.\nThe Millennium Development Goals embody a\nquantifiable vision of human dignity and solidarity, as\nwell as of important economic and social rights. Yet,\nimportant objectives, such as employment, critical for\ndeveloping countries, are excluded. India\u2019s use of\ninnovative financial instruments for rural\ninfrastructural investment, as well as our Rural\nEmployment Guarantee Bill \u2014 recently passed in\nParliament \u2014 I believe may be of interest to other\ndeveloping countries.\nMost of us had much higher expectations of the\nsummit in the area of development, particularly in\nagreeing on a definite timetable for the achievement of\nthe 0.7 per cent target for official development\nassistance. Unfortunately, that has not been achieved,\nand we have gone down to 0.5 per cent. That is equally\ntrue of innovative sources of financing because\ndeveloping countries cannot break out of the cycle of\npoverty without enhanced resource flows and the\napplication of science and technology to meet their\ndevelopmental challenges.\nAs India\u2019s own economy develops \u2014 at about 8\nper cent per year \u2014 and its technological advancement\ncomes of age, we are expanding our economic and\ntechnical cooperation with the developing countries,\nreinforcing our political solidarity. We have extensive\nprogrammes in Africa and elsewhere in the developing\nworld. We are also happy to have contributed to the\nSouth Fund for Development and Humanitarian\nAssistance. The India-Brazil-South Africa Facility for\nAlleviation of Poverty and Hunger is a good example\nof South-South cooperation.\nIndia has written off the debts of all the highly\nindebted poor countries. Given India\u2019s long-term\nassociation with and commitment to Africa, we\n27\n\nwelcome the recognition given by the High-level\nPlenary Meeting to the need to urgently address the\nspecial needs of our African brothers and sisters. On its\npart, India has undertaken several initiatives in\npartnership with Africa. The Techno-Economic\nApproach for Africa-India Movement initiative is\ndesigned to promote technology transfer to West\nAfrica. The pivotal role of scientific knowledge and\ntechnology for economic development cannot be\noverstated. India stands ready to share its experience\nwith the developing countries of Africa and elsewhere.\nTo bridge the digital divide within a country\nitself, which sometimes becomes as problematic as it is\nat the international level, wireless local loop\ntechnology developed in India, which eliminates\nexpensive equipment and copper lines, has already\nbeen used in several countries in Africa. India has put\ntogether a connectivity mission in Africa, using fiber\noptics and dedicated satellite. It will support tele-\neducation, telemedicine, e-commerce and e-\ngovernance, infotainment, resource mapping and\nmeteorological services. India is also earmarking $1.5\nbillion for lines of credit to assist developing countries,\nin particular those in Africa, in fighting HIV\/AIDS and\nother pandemics.\nThe international community needs to address\nintellectual property regimes that seek to deny\ntechnologies rather than facilitating their transfer to the\ndeveloping countries, including in the areas of\nenvironment and public health.\nAlthough both the Millennium Declaration and\nthe outcome document have spoken of exploiting the\nbeneficial aspects of globalization, we are yet to agree\non and implement the modalities for such a process.\nMaking the process of globalization fairer and more\nequitable remains one of the main challenges of our\ntime. At present, the accumulation of wealth is\naccompanied by the accumulation of poverty. Ruskin,\nthe nineteenth century British author, in his book Unto\nthis Last \u2014 a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi \u2014\ndescribed such wealth as \u201cthe gilded index of a far-\nreaching ruin, a wrecker\u2019s pile of coin gleaned from a\nbeach to which he has beguiled an argosy.\u201d Poverty is\nsometimes attributed to lack of entrepreneurship. The\npoor of the world prove their entrepreneurship every\nday by ensuring their families\u2019 physical survival.\nRegrettably, the summit has not given a clear and\ncomprehensive direction to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Doha Round of trade\nnegotiations. Formulas are not an end in themselves;\nthe end has to be a decrease in poverty and an increase\nin employment. Therefore, equal treatment cannot be\nforced on unequal partners. Special and differential\ntreatment remains an integral component of all trade\nnegotiations, including agriculture and non-agricultural\nmarket access. India, as a member of the G-20, will\ncontinue to promote in the WTO and elsewhere the\ninterests of all developing countries, including the\nsmall island developing States, the least developed, the\nlandlocked and the highly indebted poor countries.\nAn achievement of the developing countries in\nthe Group of 77 is their hard-fought and reasonably\nsuccessful struggle for progress on systemic issues\ncritical to good international economic governance. We\nhave to build on that to ensure the reform of Bretton\nWoods institutions and the restoration of the central\nrole of the United Nations in setting the international\neconomic agenda.\nA change in the composition of the Security\nCouncil is an imperative. The G-4 framework\nresolution has made United Nations reform a central\nissue that can no longer be ignored or disregarded.\nThere is a democracy deficit, as the Secretary-General\nalso said in July, in the governance of the United\nNations. There is not much point in speaking of\ninclusiveness, transparency and democracy and leaving\nthe Security Council as a glaring exception to those\nprinciples. Measures taken so far to revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly are simply not enough. Only by\nelecting permanent members committed to rendering\nunto the General Assembly what is the General\nAssembly\u2019s can that be done. That is essential for a\nworld order in which decisions are optimal and\ntherefore acceptable, and the use of force minimal.\nJawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first Prime Minister,\naptly stated: \u201cAbove all, we have to participate in the\ngrowing structure of a world order. We cannot rely on\nothers to do it on our behalf.\u201d One cannot argue in\nfavour of democracy in the rest of the world and leave\nthe Security Council undemocratic. Effectiveness is a\nfunction of right decisions with broad support.\nNegotiations on the outcome document and many\nsubsequent statements have demonstrated that, if more\ncould not be achieved on the development aspects of\ntrade in the document, it is because the Security\nCouncil has not been made representative. If\ninstitutional reform has been faltering and many are\n28\n\ndoubtful of securing a just solution, it is because the\nSecurity Council does not reflect the world of today. It\nreflects the world of 1945.\nThe unsatisfactory progress on other issues shows\nthat critics of Security Council expansion in both the\ncategories were profoundly mistaken. Security Council\nreform, far from hindering progress, was actually\nhelping it. In its absence, fears of intervention have\nprevented agreement on a human rights council and\nother issues. Therefore, Security Council reform\nremains more necessary than ever and should\npreferably, as the Secretary-General has said, be\ncompleted by the end of the year. That should be our\nmain priority; I doubt if it is. Security Council reform\nis not about any country\u2019s prestige or power, but about\ntransforming the balance of power in the world. Our\nexperience in India from the freedom movement to\npresent times shows that diversity is a source of\nstrength and effectiveness. The same would be true of a\nreformed Security Council. We would continue also to\nengage actively in the strengthening of the Economic\nand Social Council, the restructuring of the Secretariat\nand the setting-up of peacebuilding commission.\nAs we observe the sixtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, I am reminded once again of the words\nof India\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who\nsaid at this very forum 45 years ago:\n\u201cDuring these past fifteen years the United\nNations has often been criticized for its structure\nand for some of its activities. These criticisms\nhave had some justification behind them, but\nlooking at the broad picture I think that we can\ndefinitely say that the United Nations has amply\njustified its existence and repeatedly prevented\nour recurrent crises from developing into war. It\nhas played a great role, and it is a little difficult\nnow to think of this troubled world without the\nUnited Nations.\u201d (A\/PV.882, para. 110)\nIn the life of individuals as well as of institutions,\nthe completion of 60 years is a significant moment for\nstocktaking \u2014 certainly in my part of the world. Even\nas we reflect upon the functioning of this institution\nsince its inception in 1945, all of us gathered here look\nforward to the realization of new hopes, aspirations\nand, indeed, to a rejuvenated United Nations which is\nfully geared to meet the myriad challenges of our times\nand effectively contribute to the well-being and\ndevelopment of humanity at large and to manage\nchange.\nThe vision which we have for a better world is\nbest described in the words of a great son of India, the\ngreat poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first\nAsian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. I\nshall end my statement by quoting a very famous text\nof his:\n\u201cWhere the mind is without fear and the head is\nheld high\nWhere knowledge is free\nWhere the world has not been broken up into\nfragments by narrow domestic walls\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards\nperfection\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its\nway\nInto the dreary desert sand of dead habit\nWhere the mind is led forward by thee\nInto ever-widening thought and action\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my\ncountry awake.\u201d",

        "text": " On behalf\nof President Bush and all of the American people,\nwelcome to New York City.\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, my fellow\ncitizens have experienced the compassion of the United\nNations. I want to thank Secretary-General Annan for\nmobilizing the support of this institution. I also want to\nthank the representatives of the 126 countries that have\noffered assistance in our relief efforts. The United\nStates will never forget their generosity in our time of\nneed.\nIn moments of tumultuous historical change,\nleaders must become architects of a better world. We\nmust survey the new international landscape, lay firm\nfoundations of moral principle and build institutions\n8\n\nthat reflect our unique moment in history. It is those\ninstitutions that enable citizens of conviction to lead us\never closer to the ideals of justice that stir every soul:\nthe universal desire for security, prosperity, liberty and\ndignity.\nSixty years ago was just such a time of\ntransformation. After one of the greatest cataclysms in\nworld history, the United States joined with visionary\nbuilders from over 50 countries to create the United\nNations. We placed the enduring principles of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms at the foundation of\nthe United Nations Charter. We built an institution that\nhas helped to support a peaceful world order for six\ndecades. Today, however, with the end of the cold war\nand the rise of globalization and the emergence of new\nthreats, the very terrain of international politics has\nshifted beneath our feet. In this new world we must\nagain embrace the challenge of building for the future.\nThe time to reform the United Nations is now. We\nmust seize this opportunity together. Chapter I, Article\n1, of the Charter of the United Nations proclaims the\nfour purposes of the United Nations, great aspirations\nthat have stood the test of time. But consider what\ndifferent forms they take today, in 2005, as opposed to\n1945, when they were first declared.\nThe first purpose of the United Nations is to help\nmaintain international peace and security. In 1945 the\nmost serious threats to peace and security emerged\nbetween States, and were largely defined by their\nborders. Today, however, the greatest threats we face\nemerge within States, and melt through their borders:\ntransnational threats like terrorism and the proliferation\nof weapons, pandemic disease and trafficking in human\nbeings.\nThe second purpose of this institution, as written\nin the United Nations Charter, is to develop friendly\nrelations among nations, based on equal rights and the\nself-determination of all peoples. In 1945, a life of\nliberty and dignity was more an aspiration than a\nreality for a majority of the world\u2019s people. Today,\nhowever, more nations than ever have enshrined the\nprinciples of democracy and human rights \u2014 a true\nmoral triumph that will be complete only when all\nindividuals are secure in their basic freedoms.\nThe third purpose of the United Nations is to\nachieve international cooperation in solving\ninternational problems. In 1945, the fear was that\nstrong, aggressive States, eager and able to expand\ntheir frontiers with force, would be the primary cause\nof international problems. Today, however, it is clear\nthat weak and poorly governed States, unwilling or\nincapable of ruling their countries with justice, are the\nprincipal source of global crises, from civil war and\ngenocide to extreme poverty and humanitarian disaster.\nThe final purpose of the United Nations, as the\nCharter states, is to be a centre for harmonizing the\nactions of nations in the attainment of common ends.\nIn 1945, the world\u2019s leaders joined together to build an\ninstitutional partnership that could address the shared\nchallenges of their time. Today, faced with the realities\nof a new world, we must transform the United Nations\nto meet the shared challenges of our time.\nThe Members of this body must work together to\nstrengthen security in a world threatened by stateless\nextremists. Today, I call on the nations of the world to\nratify the comprehensive convention on terrorism. No\ncause, no movement and no grievance can justify the\nintentional killing of innocent civilians and non-\ncombatants. That is unacceptable by any moral\nstandard. It is time for every Member of the United\nNations to outlaw acts of international terrorism.\nWe must also work together to promote\nprosperity and development in a world of great\npotential. The United States is committed to the\nMillennium Development Goals. And at the Monterrey\nConference three years ago all nations agreed that\ndevelopment must be a two-way street. Donor\ncountries have a responsibility to increase their\nassistance to developing nations. And developing\nnations have a responsibility to govern justly, advance\neconomic liberty and invest in their people. The\nMonterrey Consensus is working.\nNow is not the time to revert to old, failed\nthinking about development. Countries representing\nthree quarters of the developing world\u2019s population are\non a pace to meet the targets of the Millennium\nDeclaration by 2015.\nAnd, as President Bush said on Wednesday, the\nUnited States is prepared to take new action to\naccelerate this progress: we will eliminate all tariffs\nand subsidies that distort free trade \u2014 as other nations\ndo the same.\nMembers of the United Nations must work\ntogether as well to support democracy in a world of\nexpanding liberty. To advance this common purpose, in\n9\n\n2004 President Bush proposed the creation of a\ndemocracy fund. With the broad support of this body,\nwe have made it a reality. The Fund is now receiving\ndonations in cash and in kind from countries large and\nsmall that wish to help other nations lay the\nfoundations of democracy. Showing its leadership as\nthe world\u2019s largest democracy, India made the generous\nopening pledge of $10 million.\nNow, to be sure, when speaking about democracy,\nthe United States has every reason for humility. After\nall, it was only in my lifetime that America guaranteed\nthe right to vote for all its citizens. Obviously, the path\nto democracy is long and imperfect and different for\nevery nation. But the principles of democracy are\nuniversal, as is the desire for them. And the United\nNations must support every country that embraces the\nchallenge of self-government. In Afghanistan, Iraq,\nLebanon, the Palestinian territories and throughout the\nworld, peoples who want to build democracy deserve\nour help.\nThe many goals we share are great indeed. And\nthe United Nations has a major role to play in their\nachievement. But for this institution to become an\nengine of change in the twenty-first century, it must\nnow change itself. The United Nations must launch a\nlasting revolution of reform.\nThe United Nations summit declaration\n(resolution 60\/1), which every head of State endorsed\nthis week, expresses a global consensus on the fact that\nreform is imperative. I want to thank former General\nAssembly President Ping for his tireless hard work.\nOur challenge now, under President Eliasson\u2019s\nleadership, is to enact the vital reforms that will make\nthe United Nations more accountable to its Members,\nmore suited to new challenges and more faithful to its\nfounding purposes.\nThe United States welcomes the commitment of\nall leaders to establish a new Peacebuilding\nCommission. Now, we must embrace the difficult task\nof implementing that vision. A Peacebuilding\nCommission should plan for post-conflict missions\nbefore crises erupt. And it must help to coordinate\nreconstruction efforts after the fighting stops. In a\nworld threatened by civil strife, the United Nations\nneeds to be better prepared to help countries rebuild in\nthe aftermath of conflict.\nWe are also pleased that the world\u2019s leaders have\nrecognized the importance of establishing a new\nHuman Rights Council. But it will take a lot of hard\nwork in the coming months to realize that goal. The\nHuman Rights Council must have fewer members, less\npolitics and more credibility. And it should never,\nnever, empower brutal dictatorships to sit in judgement\nof responsible democracies. The Human Rights\nCouncil must have the moral authority to condemn all\nviolators of human rights, even those that sit among us\nin this Hall.\nFinally, we welcome the promise of the world\u2019s\nleaders to make the United Nations a more effective\nand a more principled institution. As President Bush\nsaid on Wednesday (see A\/60\/PV.2), the United\nNations must stand for integrity and live by the high\nstandards it sets for others. For the United Nations to\nchampion democracy more legitimately, we must\nincrease the transparency and the accountability of this\ninstitution. For the United Nations to promote\nprosperity more credibly, tougher ethics rules and\ngreater internal oversight are needed to ensure the\nhighest professional standards. And to make the United\nNations relevant to the challenges of today, the purpose\nand the performance of all United Nations programmes\nmust be reviewed thoroughly, consistently and\ncomprehensively.\nOur fellow citizens deserve a United Nations that\ncommands their respect and is worthy of their hard-\nearned tax dollars. In a democracy, leaders must be\nable to justify that their people\u2019s money is indeed being\nwell spent.\nReal progress on those fundamental reforms will\nprove that the United Nations can address greater\nissues of change, in particular the reform of the\nSecurity Council. We want that important body to\nreflect the world as it is in 2005, not as it was in 1945.\nThe United States is open to expanding the Security\nCouncil. We have long supported a permanent seat for\nJapan. And we believe that developing countries\ndeserve greater representation on that body. All this\nwould make for a more effective Security Council.\nAnd the Security Council must be effective. It\nmust be able to deal with great challenges such as\nterrorism and nuclear proliferation, especially when it\nfaces real threats and when countries such as Iran\nthreaten the effectiveness of the global non-\nproliferation regime. When diplomacy has been\n10\n\nexhausted, the Security Council must become involved.\nQuestions about Iran\u2019s nuclear activities remain\nunanswered, despite repeated efforts by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. And after\nagreeing to negotiate with Europe, Iran unilaterally\nwalked away from the talks and restarted its nuclear\nprogrammes. Iran should return to the negotiations\nwith the European Union three and abandon forever its\nplans for a nuclear-weapons capability.\nThe experience of recent years has reinforced the\nuniversal truth that international institutions are only as\nstrong and effective and relevant as their members\nchoose to make them. The United Nations is no\ndifferent.\nThe United States believes in a United Nations\nthat is strong and effective. And we have ambitious\nhopes for its future.\nSo in this year, as the United Nations marks its\nsixtieth anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to\nprincipled action. Let us embrace the same spirit of\ncreation that moved the builders and leaders of 1945.\nAnd let us reform this great institution to meet the\nchallenges of a new era.",

        "text": "\ufeffPlease allow me warmly to congratulate Mr. Hunte, on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I would also like\nto thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his valuable contribution as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\nI also take this opportunity to express my\nheartfelt condolences on the recent tragic deaths in\nBaghdad of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\nother United Nations staff members.\nThe twenty-first century is about to complete its\nthird year, with hope and distress coexisting side by\n28\n\nside. Peace and development remain the overriding\nthemes of the times and the shared aspirations of\npeople of all races, colours and nationalities. The\nconcept of democracy and equality has planted deep\nroots in the hearts of the people. The shared\nconfrontation of global challenges through stronger\ncoordination and cooperation has become the\nconsensus of the international community.\nCountries are increasingly closer in their\neconomic relations. Advanced means of\ncommunications have made it possible to share\ninformation in real time. With their interests closely\nconnected and intertwined, countries are finding\nthemselves more and more like passengers in the same\nboat. Regional cooperation has grown substantially in\nboth depth and scope, with cooperation mechanisms\ntaking shape at various levels. Regional economic\nintegration is forging ahead in many parts of the world.\nThere are, however, many worrisome aspects of\nthe international situation. Local wars and conflicts\ncontinue to emerge sporadically. Although the Iraq war\nis over, peace remains elusive, with no end of suffering\nin sight for the Iraqi people. With the situation between\nIsrael and Palestine still experiencing ups and downs,\nthe Middle East peace process remains a long, uphill\njourney. In Africa, wars are still raging in some\ncountries.\nNon-traditional security concerns such as\nterrorism, drug-trafficking, arms proliferation, the\nspread of diseases and environmental degradation have\nbecome more pronounced. Given modern conditions,\nthey can easily spread within regions or even across the\nworld, making the security situation of human\ncommunities even more complicated.\nHumankind still confronts severe challenges in its\ndevelopment. In the past 30 years, the number of least\ndeveloped countries has doubled, reaching 50, which\naccounts for one quarter of the United Nations\nmembership. The ever-widening gap between the North\nand South and the aggravated disparity between the\nrich and the poor have become a major factor breeding\nnew conflicts and wars and undermining regional\nstability.\nAt a moment like this, people are inevitably\npondering the same question: in the interest of world\npeace and common development, what kind of new\nworld order should we establish in the twenty-first\ncentury?\nChina is of the view that the future well-being of\nhumankind hinges on closer international cooperation\nand a multipolar world. We should promote democracy\nin international relations. Multipolarization does not\nmean back-pedalling into the age of spheres of\ninfluence or a replay of the now long-gone rivalry of\nmajor Powers. It simply means bringing about a new\nregime of international relations under which all\ncountries \u2014 big or small, rich or poor, strong or\nweak \u2014 are treated as equals, and under which no\ncountry has the right to impose its will on others.\nWe should cultivate a new security concept based\non the principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit,\nequality and cooperation. Security should be\nmaintained through cooperation, and disputes should\nbe resolved peacefully through dialogue. The frequent\nuse of force and the threat of its use should be avoided.\nThe practice of building one\u2019s own security at the\nexpense of others should be rejected.\nWe should support diversity in the process of\ndevelopment. Our world is a place of many colours and\nstyles. A single musical note cannot make a melody,\nnor does a phonetic alphabet make a language. Human\nwisdom has produced so many civilizations, allowing\nus to follow different paths of development and a\nvariety of values. It is through the exchanges,\nemulations and integrations of diverse cultures that\nhuman reason and wisdom shine brilliantly.\nWe should dedicate ourselves to the\nempowerment of developing countries in their large\nnumbers. The developing countries, which make up\nthree quarters of the world\u2019s population, should\nbecome a key pillar of a multipolar world. Without\ntheir extensive participation on an equal footing, there\nwill be no democracy in international relations or a fair\nand rational world order. Without their economic\nrevitalization, there can be no common development of\nall humankind to speak of.\nWe should step up multilateral cooperation.\nMultilateral cooperation in various forms should\nbecome the principal vehicle in the handling of\ninternational affairs. Countries should join hands in\ntaking on global challenges through globalized\ncooperation.\nIn a multipolar world, countries should respect\nand consult with one another politically, strive for\ncommon development by helping one another\neconomically, prosper together by drawing on one\n29\n\nanother\u2019s cultural strengths and jointly maintain\nsecurity through mutual trust, thus working hand in\nhand to realize the peace and prosperity of humankind.\nMore than half a century ago, our forefathers\ngathered to give birth to the United Nations. The past\n58 years have seen the Organization\u2019s notable\naccomplishments in preserving peace in regions and\naround the world and in promoting human development\nand progress. The spirit of the United Nations\nCharter \u2014 characterized by such words as \u201cto live\ntogether in peace with one another as good neighbours\u201d\nand \u201cto promote social progress and better standards of\nlife in large freedom\u201d \u2014 has been widely accepted in\nthe international community.\nThe United Nations has become the most\nuniversal, most representative and most authoritative\ninternational organization in the world today. This is\nwhat history affirms and what reality mandates.\nChina maintains that in the current situation the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nshould be adhered to and earnestly abided by with a\nview to realizing democracy, the rule of law in\ninternational relations and the mutually advantageous\ncoexistence of the countries of the world.\nIn handling affairs affecting regional or\ninternational peace, all Member States are obliged to\nmaintain the leading role and authority of the United\nNations and its Security Council. China is in favour of\nan important role for the United Nations in Iraq\u2019s post-\nwar arrangements and reconstruction and supports the\nrestoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people at an early\ndate.\nChina also supports the United Nations carrying\nout the necessary reforms to enhance its role and\neffectiveness in the light of changing circumstances.\nThe United Nations is a microcosm of our world.\nThe world\u2019s hope rests on a strong United Nations. In\norder to build a better future for humankind, it is\nincumbent upon us first to turn the United Nations into\na forum for cooperation instead of an arena of\nrecrimination. No country is entirely populated by\nsaints and therefore no country should have the right to\nthrow the stones of prejudice.\nTo that end, we should forsake all the old\nbaggage of arrogance, estrangement and narrow-\nmindedness and let harmony, understanding and\ntolerance ring out loudly as the undiminished themes of\nthis great Hall. The ocean is made great by all the\nrivers it takes in. Let that be the motto of all Member\nStates.\nDevelopment is the foundation for world peace\nand human progress. We stand for stronger\ninternational cooperation and the achievement of\ncommon development.\nThe current state of affairs \u2014 in which the gap\nbetween the North and the South has been widening\nwithout pause, with some countries of the South\nlanguishing in dire poverty \u2014 must be changed without\nfurther delay. The key lies in establishing a fair and\nequitable new world economic order in response to the\nrequirements of economic globalization.\nAn open and fair multilateral trading regime\nshould be established and improved. The principles of\nmutual understanding and mutual accommodation\nshould be followed to bring about due progress in\nmultilateral trade talks. Close attention should be given\nto reforming and improving the international financial\nsystem, setting up a financial early-warning mechanism\nand enhancing the capacity of countries to prevent and\ndeal with financial crises.\nStronger South-South cooperation and North-\nSouth exchanges should be promoted. The developing\ncountries should step up their cooperation and\ncoordination and gradually change their\ndisadvantageous position in the economic globalization\nprocess. This coming December, the second ministerial\nconference of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum\nwill be held in Addis Ababa, where the two sides will\nwork together to deepen their equality-based and\nmutually beneficial cooperation and open up a new\nhorizon in South-South cooperation.\nThe developed countries should also shoulder\ntheir duties and responsibilities by giving greater\nsupport to the developing countries in the areas of\nmarket access, funding, technology transfer, debt relief\nand trade terms.\nAll human communities make an organic whole\nwhen it comes to development. When hundreds of\nmillions of fellow human beings are suffering from\ncold and hunger, the rich countries should not nor\ncannot enjoy their riches by themselves for long. The\nstriking contrast in wealth is eroding the very dignity\nthat all human beings share. Upon the monstrous gap\n30\n\nbetween the North and South cannot stand the great\nedifice of future prosperity.\nWhile addressing the development issue, it is\nnecessary to highlight the need for a harmonious\ndevelopment of the economy and society.\nAt present, humankind\u2019s further development is\nbeing increasingly hampered by excessive population\ngrowth, environmental degradation, energy depletion,\nthe decline and demise of indigenous cultures, and\nother constraints. Sustainable development can be truly\nrealized only when there is harmony, mutual\ncomplementarity and mutual promotion between the\neconomy and society, and between their development\nand nature.\nIn the first half of the year, SARS struck a\nnumber of regions and countries, which testifies yet\nagain to the crucial importance of public health in the\ncontext of development. While countries should\nstrengthen their public health systems, the world in\ngeneral should enhance its capacity to deal with major\ndiseases and disasters through an improved globalized\ncontingency response mechanism.\nThe Chinese Government supports the proposal\nmade by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\ncertain countries at the fifty-sixth World Health\nAssembly for the establishment of a global fund\nagainst SARS and is ready to contribute to it. We call\non all countries to support the United Nations in its\nrelevant activities, including incorporating public\nhealth into United Nations development programmes\nand other action plans and promoting regional and\ninternational cooperation in this regard.\nLast fall, the Communist Party of China convened\nits 16th National Congress, which called for the\nbuilding, during the first two decades of the twenty-\nfirst century, of a society that is well off in all respects.\nThis past spring, a new Chinese Central Government\nwas elected at the 10th National People\u2019s Congress \u2014\nthus a smooth leadership transition was realized.\nIn the first half of the year, the people of China\nput up a heroic fight against SARS and won a\nresounding victory. Many friendly countries and\npersonalities in the world, together with the World\nHealth Organization and other United Nations\nagencies, have rendered us valuable support and\nassistance, for which I wish to express our heartfelt\ngratitude.\nChina has kept its economic growth in high gear.\nThe first two quarters saw the nation\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct grow by 8.2 per cent over the corresponding\nperiod of last year, and foreign trade grow by 39 per\ncent. China\u2019s economic efficiency has improved\nmarkedly, and its reforms on all fronts are progressing\nin an orderly way.\nNeedless to say, China is a developing country. It\nstill has a long way to go before all its citizens can live\na comfortable, even affluent life. Development,\ntherefore, remains China\u2019s top priority.\nChina\u2019s development requires a peaceful\ninternational and surrounding environment. We will\ncontinue to pursue an independent foreign policy of\npeace and will seek to play a constructive role in\nregional and international affairs.\nChina will continue to push for friendship and\ngood-neighbourliness in the interest of peace and\ntranquillity in the region. Based on our support for a\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula on which peace and\nstability should be maintained, we initiated and\nsponsored the three-party Beijing talks and the first\nround of six-party talks. China remains committed to\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\npeacefully through dialogue and the building of a\nlasting peace there.\nTo develop, China needs the world, and a\nprosperous world also needs China. The market and\ncooperation potential unleashed by a rapidly\ndeveloping China could bring fresh and immeasurable\nopportunities to the region and to the world at large.\nWe desire peace, stability and development. We\naspire to equality, mutual benefit and a win-win result\nfor all. Conforming to the tide of history, China has\nopted for the path of peaceful development, linking its\nrejuvenation with that of the region, with the interests\nof the majority of countries, and with the lofty cause of\npeace and development for humanity. We hereby\npledge our continued and ever-greater contribution to\nworld prosperity and progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\ufeffSergio\nVieira de Mello was the pride of the United Nations.\nMurdered on 19 August along with his colleagues, he\nwill remain in our memories. Let us dedicate this\nsession to that great servant of the world and of peace.\nThe United Nations has just emerged from one of\nthe most serious challenges in its history. Respect for\nthe Charter and the use of force were at the heart of the\ndebate. The war, which was launched without the\nSecurity Council's authorization, has undermined the\nmultilateral system.\nHaving come to terms with that crisis, our\nOrganization can now continue to move forward; for it\nis above all in this forum   the melting pot of the\ninternational order   that we must exercise our\nresponsibilities to the world of today as well as to\nfuture generations.\nIn an open world no one can live in isolation, no\none can act alone in the name of all and no one can\naccept the anarchy of a society without rules. There is\nno alternative to the United Nations. But in order to\nmeet today's challenges, this fundamental choice,\nexpressed by the Charter, requires a far-reaching\nreform of our Organization.\nMultilateralism is crucial, because it ensures the\nparticipation of all in the management of world affairs.\nIt is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy,\nespecially when decisions must be made with respect to\nthe use of force or to the laying down of universal\nnorms.\n15\n\nMultilateralism is effective. In Monterrey and\nJohannesburg, it allowed us to transcend North-South\nconfrontation and to open the way to promising\npartnerships, in particular with the African continent.\nMultilateralism is modern, because it alone makes\nit possible to comprehend contemporary problems\nglobally and in all of their complexity.\nFirst, let me touch on the settlement of conflicts\nthat threaten international peace and security.\nIn Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis,\nwho must have sole responsibility for their destiny, is\nessential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to the\nUnited Nations to lend its legitimacy to that process. It\nis also up to the United Nations to assist with the\ngradual transfer of administrative and economic\nresponsibilities to the Iraqi institutions, according to a\nrealistic timetable, and to help the Iraqis draft a\nconstitution and hold general elections.\nFinally, it is up to the United Nations to entrust a\nmandate to a multinational force, commanded,\nnaturally, by the main troop contributor   that is, the\nUnited States   in order to ensure the security of Iraq\nand of all those helping to rebuild the country.\nThus the international community and the Iraqi\npeople, united around a common project, will together\nput an end to the tragic decades of that great country's\nhistory.\nIn the Middle East, ravaged by despair and\nhatred, only strong political will on both sides to\nimplement the law as stipulated by the United Nations\ncan pave the way for a just and lasting solution.\nThe international community must restore a\ndynamic for peace. It must involve itself in the\nimplementation of the road map. That should be the\nobjective of the upcoming meeting of the Quartet, to be\nheld at the ministerial level. France believes that the\nidea of a monitoring mechanism is as relevant as ever,\nand that the convening of an international conference is\na goal to be attained as quickly as possible.\nGiven the present tense situation, France calls on\nthe parties not to succumb to the temptation of a test of\nstrength and of a futile radicalization.\nAnother major challenge is the fight against\ninternational terrorism. This fight is well under way,\nunder the auspices of the Security Council and within\nthe context of our treaties. The horror of 11 September\ncemented our common resolve. This threat strikes at\nthe very heart of our democracies and our societies. We\nare using force to combat terrorism, but that is not\nenough. It will re-emerge again and again if we allow\nextremism and fanaticism to flourish   if we fail to\nrealize that it seeks justification in the world's\nunresolved conflicts and economic and social\nimbalances.\nGiven the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, we reject the policy of fait accompli. We\nmust stand united to guarantee the universality of\ntreaties and the effectiveness of non-proliferation\nregimes. In order to ensure compliance, we must also\ndevelop our means of action. France has proposed the\ncreation of a permanent corps of inspectors under the\nauthority of the Security Council. Let us give fresh\nimpetus to this policy. Let us convene a summit\nmeeting of the Security Council to outline a true plan\nof action of the United Nations against proliferation.\nAt this time, let us demand that North Korea\ncompletely, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle its\nmilitary programme. Let us demand that Iran sign and\nimplement, unconditionally and without delay, a\nstrengthened nuclear safeguards agreement with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\nSustainable development poses yet another\nchallenge, because half of humankind is living in\nconditions of insecurity or extreme poverty. Will we be\nable to globalize solidarity, as our peoples demand, in\nresponse to the inevitable globalization of the\neconomy?\nWe agree on the objectives. We are bound by the\nMillennium Goals. But, in order to attain those goals,\nstrong political impetus remains necessary. I propose\nthat heads of State and Government meet in New York\nin 2005 for a preliminary progress review. I hope that\nthis session of the General Assembly will confirm the\ndetermination of States to overcome the failure of\nCancun and to ensure the success of the Doha\nDevelopment Round.\nIn order to carry out the missions entrusted to it\nand to remedy its blatant shortcomings, the United\nNations must evolve. Three watchwords, I believe,\nmust guide us: democracy, authority, effectiveness.\nThanks to the Secretary-General, progress has been\nmade, and new avenues are opening up. It is now up to\nStates to move forward without further ado and to put\n16\n\nan end to the adverse consequences of the stalemate\nover reforms.\nThe United Nations is suffering from the current\nweakness of the General Assembly. And yet, it is here\nthat a debate should be organized and a consensus\ncrafted regarding solutions to major problems. A\nculture of confrontation must give way to a culture of\naction aimed at achieving our common goals, which we\nshould determine together.\nThe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\npeace and security rests with the Security Council. It is\ntherefore essential to its legitimacy that its composition\nreflect the state of the world. It must be expanded to\ninclude new permanent members, because the presence\nof major countries is necessary. France, naturally, is\nthinking of Germany and of Japan, but also of some\nleading countries of Asia, Africa and America. We also\nneed new elected members, to make the Council even\nmore representative. With the decisive impetus of the\nfive permanent members, we all need to resume\ndiscussions, mindful of the general interest.\nSuch reform should be accompanied by a\nstrengthening of the Council's authority. It is the\nCouncil that should set the bounds with respect to the\nuse of force. No one can claim the right to use force\nunilaterally and preventively. Conversely, in the face of\nmounting threats, States must be assured that the\nCouncil has at its disposal the appropriate means of\nevaluation and of collective action, and that it has the\nwill to act.\nWe all are very committed to the sovereignty of\nStates. But its scope can and should be limited in the\ncase of serious violations of human rights and of\nhumanitarian law. The Security Council is taking steps\nin that direction, and France supports this development.\nMeanwhile, crimes against humanity are being\nsuppressed more effectively with the establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction is\nuniversal. This historic step forward must be\naccompanied by a strengthening of the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, under a\ncommission equipped to discharge its duties and its\nmission.\nWe now realize that globalization demands\nstronger economic, social and environmental\ngovernance. To that end, France proposes the creation\nof a new political forum representative of the present\neconomic state of today's world in all its diversity.\nThat council would be responsible for providing the\nnecessary impetus to international institutions, for\nimproving their coordination and for anticipating and\ntackling global problems more effectively.\nEffectiveness also depends on increased financial\nresources. France calls for two changes.\nFirst, the trend towards increasing voluntary\ncontributions at the expense of mandatory\ncontributions must be reversed. Failing that, we will\nend up with a pick-and-choose United Nations, which\nis an outdated vision and a harmful one.\nSecondly, we need to make progress in\nmobilizing funds for development and development\nassistance. France wants to meet the official\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent by the\nyear 2012. But this effort, together with that of the\nEuropean Union, will obviously not suffice to release\nthe necessary funds needed to finance the Millennium\nGoals each year. France therefore supports the\ninnovative concept of an international financial facility.\nI would also like us to give pragmatic, speedy\nconsideration to international solidarity levies, a kind\nof tax on the wealth generated by globalization and\ngiven over to development.\nTo advance on these issues, I completely approve\nof the Secretary-General's intention to gather around\nhim a committee of independent wise men and women\nresponsible for submitting proposals.\nAgainst the risk of a world without order\ndelivered up to violence, let us work to establish the\nrule of international law. Against the injustice and\nsuffering of a world of widening inequalities   even\nthough it has never been so rich   let us choose\nsolidarity. Against the chaos of a world shaken by\necological disasters, let us call for a sharing of\nresponsibility around a United Nations environmental\norganization. Against the barbarity of a world in which\nfundamental rights are all too often held up to ridicule,\nwhere the integrity of mankind is under threat, where\nindigenous peoples   the heirs to an irreplaceable\nheritage   vanish amid silence and indifference, let us\nuphold the demands of ethics. Against the peril of a\nclash of civilizations, finally, let us insist on the equal\ndignity of cultures, respect for diversity and the value\nof dialogue.\n17\n\nWith the Charter adopted in the name of the\nPeoples of the United Nations, the founders proclaimed\ntheir faith in these ideals. Let us seek to be worthy of\nthem. Let us establish the United Nations at the heart\nof this planetary democracy that is so vital in our day\nand age.\n\n\n",

        "text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to convey to you,\nSir, and to your friendly country, Saint Lucia, our\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. I would like to express my\nappreciation to you personally and my full confidence\nin your ability to effectively conduct the work of the\nAssembly at this session.\nI would also like to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, who led the work of the\nAssembly at its last session with wisdom and expertise.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto the Secretary-General and to express the gratitude of\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his continuous and\ntireless efforts to establish peace and security in the\nworld, strengthen the role of the Organization, increase\nits efficiency, preserve its credibility and enhance its\neffectiveness.\nIt is saddening and distressful that this session is\nconvening while the echo of the horrendous attack\nagainst the United Nations offices in Baghdad that took\nthe life, among others, of one of its prominent and\ntowering figures, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello is still\nresonating in our hearts. I avail myself of this\nopportunity to convey to the Secretary-General, to the\nstaff of the Secretariat and to the families of the\nvictims of this tragic incident my sincere and deepest\ncondolences. I would also like to express the hope that\nneither this incident nor the most recent one that took\nplace a few days ago will impede the efforts aimed at\npromoting the role of the United Nations in\nconsolidating stability and prosperity in Iraq.\nThe hideous attack on the United Nations offices\nin Baghdad represents a challenge that can be dealt\nwith and contained, and the necessary security\nconditions to minimize such occurrences in the future\ncan be established. However, our Organization is, at\nthis juncture, facing other challenges that are more\nserious than what happened in Baghdad, challenges\nrelated to its raison d''tre and to the principles and\nfoundations stipulated in its Charter. These principles\nwere not heeded and the responsibility for this is ours.\nThis has in many instances impeded its effectiveness\nand credibility.\nNevertheless, its ability to exist and perform and\nthe contributions it has provided and continues to\nprovide in various humanitarian, cultural and social\nfields through its specialized agencies are sufficient to\nencourage support for the Organization and provide it\nwith every assistance it needs.\nIn the comprehensive speech he gave at the outset\nof this session, the Secretary-General referred with\nclarity and transparency to the growing trend towards\nunilateral action outside the realm of international\nlegitimacy in dealing with current problems such as\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. This expanding trend to resort to unilateral\naction on the basis of the right to self-defence could\nundermine the principle of collective security on which\nthe Charter was founded. We stressed this in the\nMillennium Declaration that was issued by the General\nAssembly three years ago.\nNevertheless, we have to admit that not\nconfronting such actions effectively and with\nseriousness and steadfastness when faced with dangers\nand threats such as those that emanated from the\n21\n\nregime of Saddam Hussein, have led, it seems, to\nconfusion. This confusion has provided the advocates\nof collective action and the defenders of unilateral\naction with parallel arguments that each group is now\nusing against the other. Whoever wants to criticize the\npolicy of unilateral action will find no difficulty\nproving that such a policy could only exacerbate and\nincrease problems.\nOn the other hand, those who criticize the\ninternational community for being lax in acting\ncollectively to confront such problems that threaten\nsecurity and stability will also come up with arguments\nto prove that such reluctance and negligence in facing\nchallenges is behind the eruption of the major crises of\nour contemporary history.\nIt was therefore natural that, due to such\ndivergence in views, a situation was reached wherein\nthe focus turned to debate and theorization rather than\nto dealing directly with current problems and deciding\non practical measures to resolve them. This is exactly\nwhat happened with respect to Iraq immediately before\nthe war.\nInternational terrorism, in all its manifestations\nand forms, represents a very dangerous challenge to\nour international Organization and to the international\ncommunity at large. It deserves our condemnation\nwhich must be resolute, categorical and unequivocal.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has expressed this\nposition at different forums and international\ngatherings.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has\nsuffered and continues to suffer from acts of terror, has\nlaunched a relentless war against terrorism, enacted\nregulations that punish perpetrators, inciters and\nsympathizers with terrorist activities and has\nintroduced counter-terrorism as one of the main\nsubjects in the curricula of its schools. It has also taken\na series of measures to close any loopholes in the way\ncharities collect money, in order to prevent funds from\nbeing diverted for unlawful purposes.\nHowever, regardless of its effectiveness, the\ninternational effort directed against terrorism will not\neradicate this phenomenon without addressing its root\ncauses and the reasons for its spread.\nThe Palestinian issue, which has become a\nconstant item on the agenda of all the sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly over the past five decades, continues\nto be a cause of instability and turmoil in the Middle\nEast region, whose nations yearn for peace, prosperity\nand development. I don't think I need to go into the\ndetails of this issue, of which you are completely\naware, but we should remember Israel's persistence in\nits provocative policies and practices, which focus on\nrepression, persecution, political assassinations,\nsettlers' issues and the ominous fence. This is an\napproach that has subverted all initiatives and\nproposals aimed at solving the Palestinian issue,\nincluding the Arab peace initiative and the road map.\nThe solutions that were presented on the\nPalestinian issue were harmed mostly by the Security\nCouncil's contradictions, especially among its\npermanent members, in dealing with resolutions in this\nregard. We see resolutions being adopted but remaining\nmere ink on paper, and when the time comes for their\nresolutions on implementation, the veto power is\ninvoked to abort implementation.\nThe only way out of this vicious circle, from our\nperspective, is for the permanent members to pledge\nnot to use the veto power when dealing with\nresolutions or measures aimed at implementing the\nsubstance of resolutions previously adopted. This\nmatter may be one of the issues that the reform team\nproposed by the Secretary-General should consider in\norder to invigorate the role of the United Nations in\nhandling current issues and challenges.\nThe people of Iraq look to our Organization to\nend the confusion, anarchy and chaos that resulted\nfrom the collapse of the previous regime. The major\nproblem facing Iraq now is the absence of a clear\nvision as for the future of Iraq and the fact that Iraq\ncannot control its own destiny. Iraq faces a grave and\ncomplicated internal situation, coupled with a delicate\nand sensitive geographical location.\nIt is therefore of utmost necessity that we set a\nclear timetable that would assure the Iraqis that they\nare close to restoring their sovereignty and\nindependence through an accelerated political process\nlinked to specific commitments, whether with regard to\nconsolidating the power of the transitional Iraqi\nGovernment or drafting a new Iraqi constitution that\nwould pave the way for the formation of a legitimate\nnational Iraqi Government under which all citizens\nwould enjoy equal rights and responsibilities.\nBased on this premise, my country views the\nTransitional Governing Council in Iraq as representing\n22\n\na positive step paving the way towards this goal. While\nwe give utmost importance to the role of the United\nNations in Iraq, we are hopeful that any debate on Iraq\nwill focus on determining its needs and finding\neffective means to respond to them, including\ncontributions by all Member States to this noble effort,\nnamely the stability of Iraq.\nThat must be done speedily, efficiently and in a\nway that would conform with the needs of Iraq. Iraq is\na country of pivotal importance, geographically and\nhistorically, in our region. It possesses natural and\nhuman resources that qualify it to take a prominent role\nin the international community. All it needs from us is\nan initial push to allow it to regain its sovereignty,\nstability and growth.\nThe manifestations of the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction are a cause of great\nconcern and tension in the Middle East. This means\nthat we must declare the Middle East and the Arab Gulf\nregion a zone free from weapons of mass destruction.\nWith regard to the need to increase the\neffectiveness and universality of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its system of\nsafeguards, monitoring and inspection, we also believe\nthat certain standards and controls must be put in place\nto assure progress in all fields of the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction. Based on this, we call\nupon all countries that have yet to join the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) to take the necessary steps\nto do so, especially Israel, and to submit their nuclear\nsites and installations to the international safeguards\nregime.\nThe international situation looks again as it used\nto be during the time of polarisation, including\nincreasing tensions, crises and divisions that have\nparalyzed the Security Council. Despite the fact that\nwe have entered the third millennium, we still lack the\nneeded commitment and collective political will to\ntranslate our commitments into reality. International\npeace and security are still but a hope and an aspiration\nfor many people and countries. Comprehensive\ndevelopment is still a dream for many and a distant\nobjective we all hope to achieve.\nIn the Middle East, where countries suffer from\nthese symptoms, we see in the ideas presented by\nPresident Bush, for the promotion of development in\nthe Middle East many positive signs, which\ncollectively present a model for fruitful cooperation\nbetween rich nations and developing countries.\nIn the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Royal\nHighness the Crown Prince presented an initiative\naimed at reforming the situation in the Arab region in\nthe economic sphere, with structural reforms as well as\nexpansion of political participation at its core. If the\nregion succeeds in benefiting from these two\ninitiatives, its future will be promising.\nThe fact that there are still chronic issues on the\nagenda of our Organization, like the Palestinian\nproblem, issues of comprehensive development and the\nemergence of issues like Iraq makes it incumbent upon\nus to embark on two parallel tracks: credibility in\nupholding the principles of the Charter, and seriousness\nin implementing United Nations resolutions. We must\nnot substitute futile and senseless arguments which\nwould be useless to us all for practical solutions.\nOur deeply rooted belief in of the important role\nthat the United Nations can play in dealing with crises\nand its efforts to avoid the horrors of war and to\nprovide means for international cooperation make us\nmore determined than ever to support this Organization\nand consolidate its constructive role. We want the\nUnited Nations to take a greater role in handling crises\nbefore they occur through the implementation of what\nis known as preventive diplomacy rather than through\npre-emptive wars, in order to preserve stability and\nmaintain international peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\ufeffToday I\nstand before the Assembly representing the voice of the\nIraqi citizen who long suffered from cruelty within and\noutside his homeland. Those within his country\ninflicted on him the worst kinds of torture: they\nattacked his honour, assaulted his family, humiliated\nhim, shackled him, oppressed him and forced him into\nmiserable wars. His brothers and his friends in the\nregion not only remained silent, ignored him and\nturned a blind eye to his catastrophe, they also\ncriticized and faulted him the moment he dared to\nspeak up. And throughout the world, those who stood\nto benefit scrambled to do business and cooperate with\nhis torturer.\nVery few accepted and spoke the truth; very few\nconsidered the catastrophe of their fellow human being\nand declared that he was a victim. He heard no\nresponse to his appeals. So the Iraqi citizen remained\nlost and doubly persecuted \u2014 first, with the injustice\nof the sword with which the dictatorial regime attacked\nhim at home, and then with the injustice of criticism \u2014\na more painful affliction \u2014 from many abroad. But the\nIraqi citizen did not give up. Rather, he was persistent\nand patient, and he continued his struggle through his\nthoughts, words and actions to achieve liberation, the\nideal for which he had always yearned most.\nI stand today before the Assembly expressing to\nMembers to the best of my ability the voice of this\nIraqi individual, declaring with him and on his behalf\nthe end of silence. I ask each Member present here to\nlisten to him.\n28\n\nI come today to present the Assembly with four\nessential truths and to demonstrate, through those\ntruths, two fundamental rights.\nThe first truth is that Iraq\u2019s long, dark night has\nended. The bitter experience of humiliation,\noppression, suppression, and dictatorship that the Iraqis\nendured for more than three decades has ended. It\nended with the fleeing of the head of the regime, along\nwith his cronies, and with the collapse of the symbols\nthat he had erected in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.\nThe second truth is that the liberation of Iraq \u2014\nand what took place was indeed liberation \u2014 could not\nhave been achieved had it not been for the resolve of\nPresident George W. Bush and the commitment of the\ncoalition, headed by the United States of America and\nthe United Kingdom. The Iraqis will never forget their\nsacrifices and the courage they displayed in Iraq\u2019s\nliberation. If today we hear the voices of those who\nquestion the intentions of the Governments of the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom in undertaking\nthe liberation, we invite them to come to visit the mass\ngraves, the drained marshes and the gassed city of\nHalabja, and to examine the list of the missing whose\nright to life was taken from them by the regime.\nThe third truth is that the liberation embodied a\nuniversal Iraqi national resolve. The liberation came as\na result of vigorous Iraqi efforts to oppose the deposed\nregime during many long years when hundreds of\nthousands of martyrs were sacrificed. The martyr\nAyatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim and his\ncompanions \u2014 may God rest their souls \u2014 were not\nthe last victims; they added another page to the annals\nof Iraqi bravery on 29 August, the day of the Iraqi\nmartyr. Nor was death by treachery spared the martyr\nAkila al-Hashemi.\nThe fourth truth is that the removal of the regime\nwas only the prelude to the birth of a new Iraq. The\nbirth that has been prepared for by so many faithful\nIraqis, both at home and abroad, is at hand.\nA unique experience awaits us in Iraq today. We\nwill succeed through our desire to do good, to achieve\ndevelopment and to let freedom spread and flourish. I\nstand here today to confirm that, with God\u2019s help, we\nin Iraq will accept nothing short of success. Iraqis are\ncapable of succeeding, and they want to succeed. We\nwill not allow a gang of mercenaries and terrorists to\ndeprive the Iraqi citizen, the Iraqi society and the Iraqi\nnation of a bright tomorrow.\nThe land of the two rivers, the cradle of\ncivilization, the land of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon and\nAssyria, the land of peace, the land of the caliphate and\nthe house of wisdom, the home of the Code of\nHammurabi and the storehouse of accumulated\nknowledge, literature, poetry and intellectual\nachievement is dependent, first and foremost, on its\nhuman resources more than on its natural and oil\nresources.\nOn the basis of its human resources, Iraq can\nundergo a qualitative sea change, moving it from the\ngrip of totalitarianism and fear to stability, prosperity\nand tolerance. What the international community puts\ninto Iraq will be returned many times over. Put your\nconfidence in Iraq and receive from it stability and\nprosperity. Not only would stability and prosperity be\nIraq\u2019s but they would spread to the rest of the region\nand the entire world.\nThe Iraq that we want to see is the Iraq of the\ninnovative individual. More than 60 per cent of Iraq\u2019s\npopulation is below the age of 20. Our first priority in\npreparing those young people for the twenty-first\ncentury is to give them cultural and educational values\nthat will enable each of them to prove themselves and\ntheir particularities in a new Iraq.\nIn the past in Iraq, as in other nations that\nsuffered under the ideologies of the twentieth century,\nthe individual was suppressed by the masses, the\nmasses by the revolution, the revolution by the party,\nand the party by the leader. The result was that the\nhuman being was lost under continuous layers of\nnegation that obliterated his individuality, making him\nan object for consumption in an ostensible defence of\nthe nation and in the name of the revolution, or to be\nsacrificed, body and soul, for the leader. The concerns\nof Iraqis are no different from those of all other peoples\nof the world. Iraqis are eager to define themselves and\nto project their singularity. The Iraq of tomorrow must\nrecognize the individual citizen as the basis of\nsovereignty and the starting point for legislation.\nThe rights of the individual are fundamental; the\nrights of the group derive from them. Iraqis, like other\npeoples, insist on their right to dignity, freedom, justice\nand peace. The assertion of such rights will build the\nfoundations of tomorrow\u2019s Iraq. The dignity of every\nIraqi, without exception, must be guaranteed, without\nconsideration for social status, political position or\neconomic situation. An accused person will not lose his\n29\n\ndignity, even if found guilty. We will begin with\ndignity because the previous regime worked futilely to\nconvince Iraqis that their dignity was an endowment\nfrom the ruler. Today, we stress that the dignity of the\nentire nation stems from the dignity of each citizen.\nAs with dignity, so with freedom. Freedom is not\na gift from the ruler or the State. Rather, it is a basic\nprinciple, the essence of a human being. Responsible\nfreedom that does not impinge upon the liberties of\nothers is the core of the social contract. Despite the\nexcesses of outsiders and infiltrators since the fall of\nthe repressive regime, Iraqis have proved to themselves\nthat freedom means neither chaos nor the law of the\njungle.\nThe individual has an instinct for freedom, and\nthus he demands justice. The previous regime\nundermined justice and transformed it into a tool of the\nState to oppress and suppress the people. The new Iraq\nwill be based on a firm justice system that ensures the\nindependence and integrity of the judiciary. After the\nsenseless wars that destroyed innumerable lives,\nleaving disaster in their wake, the new Iraq will adopt a\nnew defensive policy based on peace. Iraq will be an\nactivist for peace for the region and the world. The\naforementioned four truths will form the foundation of\nIraq\u2019s political future.\nIraq will abide strictly and explicitly by all\nhuman rights instruments, beginning with the\nDeclaration of Human Rights, guaranteeing the right of\nman to life, property and the pursuit of happiness.\nWe pledge that Iraqi laws and legislation apply\nequally to all the people. No person will be above the\nlaw for any reason, regardless of merit or individual\nresponsibility. Indeed, there will be no distinction on\nthe basis of religion, sect, race, language, ethnicity,\ngender, class or tribe. The defunct regime exploited\nthose divisions for its own ends. The new Iraq will rely\non justice and fairness.\nIraqi women are capable of innovative excellence\nand productivity and can take on all the responsibilities\nof the nation. It is the duty of society and the State to\nremove any obstacles in their way.\nThe constant dialogue that is required between\nIraqi citizens and the State that represents and serves\nthem will take place on the basis of an honest,\ndemocratic and representational system. This system is\nbased on the principle of the separation of powers, and\nfirmly upholds elections as the ultimate arbiter. We are\nnot concerned with the dressings of democracy, but\nwith the safety of the political system as the\nincarnation of the democratic spirit.\nThe pillars of this system are, first and foremost,\nthe separation of powers in the framework of a written\nconstitution that avoids duplication in the judicial,\nlegislative and executive powers. That will provide a\nsound basis for each to oversee the other. Secondly,\naccountability will be ensured as a result of such\nsupervision and by means of elections that will provide\nfor the participation of individuals in politics. Finally,\ncivil society will be empowered by means of a free\npress, unions and independent institutions, which will\nact as monitors and critics and represent the plurality of\npolitical forces in the country.\nThe third pillar is the upholding of transparency\nas a fundamental principle, based on the sovereignty of\nthe individual citizen. The State exists to serve, and is\nanswerable to the citizen, who is entitled to inquire into\nits affairs. The State does not have the right to withhold\ninformation on its affairs. The fourth pillar is\nrecognition by the minority of the right of the majority\nto assume power, and the respect by the majority of the\nrights of the minority. Here, it is important to\ndistinguish between a political majority and minority\nand a factional majority and minority. Political\nmajorities and minorities are determined by the ballot\nbox, not by a population census or random correlations.\nNo one has the authority to arrogate to himself a\npolitical right on the basis of a presumed factional\nmajority. We do not want a political, sectarian or\nnational allocation in Iraq. A sound representative,\nfederal political system can best express the interests of\nall Iraqi citizens in a manner that reflects their religion,\ncreed, ethnicity or language.\nThe previous period was characterized by\nrestricting all power to an abusive few in Baghdad, but\ntomorrow\u2019s Iraq will be based on the principle of local\nauthority in the context of a federal union. Federalism\nas construed by Iraqis is not based on the division of\nthe homeland; rather, it is a way of empowering and\nrehabilitating those living in different regions to take\ndirect responsibility for their affairs in their own\nregions, without constant interference from the central\nGovernment.\nOur constitution charts the relationship between\nintegrated and continuous local and national\n30\n\nauthorities. We rely on the federal system, as we do on\nthe democratic system, because we have a clear\nunderstanding of the relationship between the State and\nits citizens. This relationship is not one of\nguardianship, because the Iraqi citizen is not a minor\nand is therefore not in need of the State\u2019s interference\nin all his affairs. Our concern is to ensure that this\nrelationship is based on care, with the State being the\nvigilant servant of the citizen, and on nurturing in some\nareas, especially with regard to the provision of\neducation and social and health services for young\npeople.\nComplementing our belief in federalism, and in\ncontrast with the vain and false nationalist excesses of\nthe previous regime, we declare that Iraq is one nation,\npermanent and whole.\nNothing in this declaration belittles the continuity\nof our Arab and Muslim heritage, or contradicts the\nsentiments of many Iraqis about their own culture and\nnational identity. Rather, it confirms that all the\nterritory of Iraq \u2014 from its mountains in the far north\nto its marshes and the Gulf in the extreme south,\nincluding its rivers, plains and deserts \u2014 is a lasting,\nindivisible unit. This is an expression not only of the\ntrue beliefs of most Iraqis, but also of a key political\nprinciple and point of reference that will help the\ncountry recognize realities on the ground and avoid\nfurther upheaval.\nWhile we seek to strengthen the rule of law and\ninstitutions of governance, we wish to make clear that\nauthority emanates from the citizen who occupies the\npolitical position not from the political post itself.\nThere must be a legal foundation in this respect, and\ndecisions must not be taken because of the whims or\nopinions of a person in authority. The previous regime\nissued many arbitrary rules, regulations and decisions\nbased on one man\u2019s views. The alternative in\ntomorrow\u2019s Iraq will be the application of the rule of\nlaw through sanctioned legislative authority that\nreflects the will of the Iraqi people, through an\nindependent judiciary and under the supervision of an\nelected legal body.\nLast but not least, let me touch on the relationship\nbetween religion and State in the new Iraq. Islam is the\nreligion of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis. It is\nvital to the Iraqi identity as well as to the State and the\nnature of governance. In any case, the great\ncivilizational heritage and rich cultural repository of\nIslamic jurisprudence is, no doubt, one of Iraq\u2019s assets,\nand we will benefit from it through a judiciary that is\nbased on equality and pluralism.\nLet me point out a truth that is often overlooked:\nthat the State, during the previous century, used\nreligion for its own ends and took from it what suited\nthose who had usurped power. They rejected the\nindependence of institutions and of religious centres,\ntaking over the Awqaf and imposing a religious\nterminology that suited their own interests, at the\nexpense of those of others. In Iraq, religion is one of\nthe most important assets of the individual and of\nsociety. We will not abandon it in any area, or reject its\njudicial, intellectual, behavioural or daily implications.\nWe call for the rehabilitation of all religious\ninstitutions by enabling them to reassume their\nresponsibilities in protecting Iraqi citizens who seek\ntheir moral and spiritual guidance without hypocritical\npolitical involvement.\nThese are the main guidelines for what we want\nfor our country.\nOur right today is to demand help and assistance\nfrom the world, thanking all those who stood by the\nIraqis in their darkest hour and forgiving those who\ninadvertently did not stand with us. It is important for\nall nations of the world to acknowledge that what\nhappened in Iraq \u2014 past atrocities and today\u2019s\nreconstruction \u2014 reflects an ongoing and dramatic\nhistorical event. The international community must\nstand shoulder to shoulder with us. That is what we\nourselves want and what we want from others on the\nroad to a free, just and peaceful Iraq.\nWe want an Iraq in which unity and plurality are\ntwo sides of the same coin. We want an Iraq that\nreturns sovereignty to the individual citizen, not to the\nleader. We want an Iraq that is secure in its cultural and\nreligious identity and engaged in open dialogue with\nthe world. We want an Iraq that embraces its past while\nlooking to the future \u2014 an Iraq that is at peace with\nitself, its neighbours and with the world. We want an\nIraq that will eradicate all Ba\u2019athists once and for all,\nbring all their officials to justice and prevent them from\nassuming power again.\n(spoke in English)\nI stand before the Assembly as the representative\nof a free Iraq. To all those here who helped us in our\nstruggle for liberation, we extend our gratitude. Our\n31\n\nliberation would not have been achieved without the\ndetermination of President George W. Bush and the\ncommitment of the coalition, at the forefront of which\nstand the people of the United States of American and\nGreat Britain. The Iraqis will never forget their courage\nand sacrifice on our behalf.\nTo those who stood with the dictator and who\ncontinued to question to intentions of the American and\nBritish Governments in undertaking this liberation \u2014\nwe invite you to come and visit the mass graves where\nhalf a million of our citizens lie. Come and visit the\ndried-up marshes, come and visit Halabja, where\nchemicals were dropped on civilians. Come and\nexamine the lists of the disappeared, whose right to life\nwas taken from them by Saddam Hussain, and we, the\nIraqi people, will ask you why you chose to remain\nsilent. We are here today to declare that a new Iraq has\nbeen born \u2014 an Iraq in which dignity, justice and\nhuman rights are assured for all citizens, an Iraq at\npeace with its people, its neighbours and the world, an\nIraq that stands ready to regain its rightful place in the\ninternational community of free and proud nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\ufeffTwenty-four months ago, and\nyesterday in the memory of America, the centre of New\nYork City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and\nthe symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day,\nterrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombassa, in\n9\n\nCasablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem,\nmeasuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and\ninnocent suffering they leave behind.\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the\nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations headquarters\nin Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For that\nreason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.\nAmong the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio\nVieira de Mello. Over the decades, that good and brave\nman from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in\nBangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon,\nCambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and\nwas aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.\nAmerica joins you, his colleagues, in honouring the\nmemory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memory\nof all those who died with him in the service of the\nUnited Nations.\nBy the victims they choose and by the means they\nuse, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.\nThose who target relief workers for death have set\nthemselves against all humanity. Those who incite\nmurder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for\nlife itself. They have no place in any religious faith,\nthey have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they\nshould have no friend in this Hall.\nEvents during the past two years have set before\nus the clearest of divides: between those who seek\norder and those who spread chaos, between those who\nwork for peaceful change and those who adopt the\nmethods of gangsters, between those who honour the\nrights of man and those who deliberately take the lives\nof men, women and children without mercy or shame.\nBetween those alternatives there is no neutral\nground. All Governments that support terror are\ncomplicit in a war against civilization. No Government\nshould ignore the threat of terror because to look the\nother way gives terrorists the chance to regroup, recruit\nand prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the lives\nof their own people depended on it will earn the\nfavourable judgement of history.\nThe former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew\nthose alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban\nwas a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When\nconfronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime\nis no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today,\nnow represents a free people who are building a decent\nand just society. They are building a nation fully joined\nin the war against terror.\nThe regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties to\nterror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It\nused those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused\nto account for them when confronted by the world. The\nSecurity Council was right to be alarmed. The Security\nCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy its\nillegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The\nSecurity Council was right to vow serious\nconsequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because\nthere were consequences   because a coalition of\nnations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of\nthe United Nations   Iraq is free, and today we are\njoined by the representatives of a liberated country.\nSaddam Hussain's monuments have been\nremoved, and not only his statues. The true monuments\nof his rule and his character   the torture chambers,\nthe rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent\nchildren   are closed. And as we discover the killing\nfields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of\nSaddam's cruelty is being revealed.\nThe Iraqi people are meeting hardships and\nchallenges, like every nation that has set out on the\npath of democracy. Yet, their future promises lives of\ndignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the\nsqualid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq,\nlife is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle\nEast, people are safer because an unstable aggressor\nhas been removed from power. Across the world,\nnations are more secure because an ally of terror has\nfallen.\nOur actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were\nsupported by many Governments, and America is\ngrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the\nsovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with our\nactions. Yet, there was and there remains unity among\nus on the fundamental principles and objectives of the\nUnited Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of our\ncollective security and to the advance of human rights.\nThose permanent commitments call us to great work in\nthe world, work that we must do together. So, let us\nmove forward. First, we must stand with the people of\nAfghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable\ncountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight\nthis progress above all because free people embrace\nhope over resentment and choose peace over violence.\nThe United Nations has been a friend of the\nAfghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping\nrefugees return home, advising on a new constitution\n10\n\nand helping to prepare the way for nationwide\nelections. NATO has taken over the United Nations\nmandated security force in Kabul. American and\ncoalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda\nterrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts\nto rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed\nto spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan\nreconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to\ncontinue contributing to that important cause.\nIn the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is\ncarrying out vital and effective work every day. By the\nend of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children\nunder age five will have been immunized against\npreventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and\nmeasles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of\nUNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational,\ndelivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,\nthanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food\nProgramme.\nOur international coalition in Iraq is meeting its\nresponsibilities. We are conducting precision raids\nagainst terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.\nThose killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They\nhave made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.\nAnd they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure\nthat Iraq's former dictator will never again use\nweapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing\nIraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime\nto reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and\nits long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi\npolice, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi\npeople can assume full responsibility for their own\nsecurity.\nAt the same time, our coalition is helping to\nimprove the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old\nregime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we\nare rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old\nregime starved hospitals of resources, so we have\nhelped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The\nold regime built up armies and weapons while allowing\nthe nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are\nrehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation\nfacilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to\nCongress that the United States provide additional\nfunding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial\ncommitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.\nHaving helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour\nour pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people\nbuild a stable and peaceful country we will make our\nown countries more secure.\nThe primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-\ngovernment for the people of Iraq, reached by an\norderly and democratic process. That process must\nunfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried\nnor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the\nUnited Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of\nIraqi self-government.\nAmerica is working with friends and allies on a\nnew Security Council resolution, which will expand the\nUnited Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of\nother conflicts, the United Nations should assist in\ndeveloping a constitution, training civil servants and\nconducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a\nGoverning Council, the first truly representative\ninstitution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are\nshowing the openness and tolerance that democracy\nrequires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every\nyoung democracy needs the help of friends. Now the\nnation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all\nnations of good will should step forward and provide\nthat support.\nThe success of a free Iraq will be watched and\nnoted throughout the region. Millions will see that\nfreedom, equality and material progress are possible at\nthe heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will\nface the clearest evidence that free institutions and\nopen societies are the only path to long-term national\nsuccess and dignity. And a transformed Middle East\nwould benefit the entire world by undermining the\nideologies that export violence to other lands.\nIraq as a dictatorship had great power to\ndestabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will\nhave great power to inspire the Middle East. The\nadvance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an\nexample that others, including the Palestinian people,\nwould be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is\nbetrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old\nhatreds and destroying the good work of others. The\nPalestinian people deserve their own State. They will\ngain that State by embracing new leaders committed to\nreform, to fighting terror and to building peace.\nAll parties in the Middle East must meet their\nresponsibilities and carry out the commitments they\nmade at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the\nconditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State\nto emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other\n11\n\nsupport for terrorist organizations. America will work\nwith every nation in the region that acts boldly for the\nsake of peace.\nA second challenge we must confront together is\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nOutlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them\nwould be able to use blackmail and create chaos in\nentire regions. Those weapons could be used by\nterrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a\nscale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination\nof outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of\nmass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished\naway. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,\nall words, all protests, will come too late.\nNations of the world must have the wisdom and\nthe will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One\ncrucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at\ntheir source. For more than a decade, the United States\nhas worked with Russia and other States of the former\nSoviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons\nand dangerous materials left over from another era.\nLast year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to\nprovide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the\nUnited States, to fight this proliferation risk over the\nnext ten years. Since then, six additional countries have\njoined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other\nnations to help us meet this danger.\nWe are also improving our capability to interdict\nlethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation\nSecurity Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to\nsearch planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect\ncargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that\nraise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed\non a set of interdiction principles consistent with\ncurrent legal authorities, and we are working to expand\nthe Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.\nWe are determined to keep the world's most destructive\nweapons away from all our shores and out of the hands\nof our common enemies.\nBecause proliferators will use any route or\nchannel that is open to them, we need the broadest\npossible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the\nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a new\nantiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call\non all Members of the United Nations to criminalize\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to\nenact strict export controls consistent with international\nstandards and to secure any and all sensitive materials\nwithin their own borders. The United States stands\nready to help any nation draft these new laws and to\nassist in their enforcement.\nA third challenge we share is a challenge to our\nconscience. We must act decisively to meet the\nhumanitarian crises of our time. The United States has\nbegun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS\nRelief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale\nand treating millions who have the disease already. We\nhave pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight\nAIDS around the world.\nMy country is acting to save lives from famine as\nwell. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in\nglobal emergency food aid, and I have asked our\nUnited States Congress for 200 million dollars for a\nnew famine fund so that we can act quickly when the\nfirst signs of famine appear. Every nation on every\ncontinent should generously add their resources to the\nfight against disease and desperate hunger.\nThere is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,\nyet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to\nnine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold\nor forced across the world's borders. Among them are\nhundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as\nyoung as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This\ncommerce in human life generates billions of dollars\neach year, much of which is used to finance organized\ncrime. There is a special evil in the abuse and\nexploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The\nvictims of the sex trade see little of life before they see\nthe very worst of life   an underground of brutality\nand lonely fear. Those who create these victims and\nprofit from their suffering must be severely punished.\nThose who patronize this industry debase themselves\nand deepen the misery of others, and Governments that\ntolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.\nThis problem has appeared in my own country\nand we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I\nsigned into law this year, makes it a crime for any\nperson to enter the United States or for any citizen to\ntravel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving\nchildren. The Department of Justice is actively\ninvestigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can\nface up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking\nVictims Protection Act, the United States is using\nsanctions against Governments to discourage human\ntrafficking.\n12\n\nThe victims of this industry also need help from\nMembers of the United Nations. This begins with clear\nstandards and the certainty of punishment under the\nlaws of every country. Today, some nations make it a\ncrime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct\nshould be a crime in all nations. Governments should\ninform travellers of the harm this industry does and the\nsevere punishments that will fall on its patrons. The\nAmerican Government is committing $50 million to\nsupport the good work of organizations that are\nrescuing women and children from exploitation and\ngiving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of\na new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.\nWe must show new energy in fighting back an old\nevil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the\ntransatlantic slave trade and more than a century after\nslavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the\ntrade in human beings for any purpose must not be\nallowed to thrive in our time.\nAll the challenges I have spoken of this morning\nrequire urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping\nAfghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a\ntransformed region; cutting off the avenues of\nproliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  \nthese are the kinds of great tasks for which the United\nNations was founded. In each case, careful discussion\nis needed and, also, decisive action. Our good\nintentions will be credited only if we achieve good\noutcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations\nCharter, the United States of America is committed to\nthe United Nations and we show that commitment by\nworking to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes\nand by giving meaning to its ideals.\nThe founding documents of the United Nations\nand the founding documents of America stand in the\nsame tradition. Both assert that human beings should\nnever be reduced to objects of power or commerce,\nbecause their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a\nmoral law that stands above men and nations, but\nwhich must be defended and enforced by men and\nnations. And both point the way to peace   the peace\nthat comes when all are free. We secure that peace with\nour courage and we must show that courage together.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to express my cordial congratulations to the\nPresident for presiding over this important session of\nthe General Assembly. I wish also to express my\ncongratulations to other members of the Bureau on\ntheir election.\nLess than 60 years ago, our founding fathers\nestablished the United Nations, with the aspiration to\npromote peace and security through cooperation and to\nmake our world a better place. The creation of this\nOrganization was in fact the manifestation of the\ninternational community's determination to prevent the\nscourge of war, which had inflicted tremendous loss\nand damage upon humankind. The United Nations was\nalso designed to promote economic, social and human\ndevelopment and assist Member States to eradicate\ninjustice and poverty.\nThese objectives and concerns remain as valid as\never and perhaps are even more relevant today. We\nbelieve it is time to take stock of recent developments\nand the utility and record of the United Nations, with a\nview to promoting the authority, efficiency and\neffectiveness of the United Nations, and recognizing its\ncentral role in addressing the challenges of our time.\nThe United States waged an unsanctioned war\nagainst Iraq with three expressed objectives: to find\nweapons of mass destruction, to fight international\nterrorism and to bring democracy to the Iraqi people.\nThe first is yet to be realized. The second has\nbackfired. And, as far as the third is concerned, the\ncollapse of a dictatorship is a highly welcome\ndevelopment in the region, but, as history has shown,\nsocial change, including the democratization of a\nsociety, can only be brought about from within, and\ncannot be imported in tandem with tank columns. In\nour view, callous indifference to the negative\n28\n \nconsequences of the invasion of Iraq to the conduct of\ninternational relations and a lack of full understanding\nof the post-war situation in Iraq, particularly the social\nand the cultural complexities of Iraqi society, have\ncreated both an international predicament and a source\nof instability at our borders.\nAs a neighbouring State, Iran adopted a policy of\nself-restraint during the war in Iraq and has continued\nto adopt a constructive approach to the current situation\nin that country by calling on the occupying Powers to\nallow the immediate transfer of Iraqi sovereignty to the\nIraqi people and to withdraw their troops. We welcome\nand support the establishment of the Iraqi Governing\nCouncil and the Council of Ministers and call for\ngranting a central and clear-cut role to the United\nNations in the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and the\nconstitutional process. We wish to promote unity and\ngreater respect for stability and security among various\nethnic and religious groups in Iraq, and encourage and\nsupport the swift setting in motion of a constitutional\nand institutional process, with a view to establishing a\ndemocratic and fully representative Government by and\nfor the people of Iraq. We urge respect for the national\nunity, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq and\nthe provision of relief emergency assistance to the\npeople of Iraq.\nPending the restoration of sovereignty and\nauthority to the people of Iraq, the occupying Powers\nhave the legal responsibility under applicable\ninternational law to provide for the welfare of the\npeople under occupation, particularly their security. In\nthis context, the United Nations should be allowed to\nplay a central role in laying the ground work, on an\nurgent basis, in assisting the Iraqi people to establish a\ndemocratic and representative Government and in\nsupervising the transfer of authority to them. The\ninternational community, in general, and Iraq's\nneighbours, in particular, will undoubtedly lend their\nfull support to the United Nations in this endeavour.\nI would like to express once again my\ncondolences to the Secretary-General and the United\nNations community as a whole for the loss of a brave\nservant of the nations, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\nother United Nations personnel in the terrorist bombing\nof the United Nations headquarters in Iraq. The people\nand Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran also\nsympathize with the people of Iraq over the loss of\nanother man of peace, Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-\nHakim, in a separate terrorist bombing in Iraq.\nThe violence against and the killing of innocent\nPalestinian people by the Israeli Army have become a\ndaily occurrence, and prospects for a viable peace are\nsteadily diminishing. The Palestinian people live under\nbrutal occupation and oppression with no hope for\nrelief, let alone peace and prosperity. The policy of the\nSharon Government of reoccupying Palestinian cities\nand using military force to further terrorize the\nPalestinian people has exacerbated the situation and\nadded to the despair and frustration of ordinary people.\nThe international community has a major responsibility\nto take effective measures in alleviating the suffering\nof the Palestinian people.\nThe recent decision of the Israeli regime to expel\nPresident Arafat from his homeland has outraged the\ninternational community, in general, and the Muslim\nworld, in particular. I am confident that the free and\ncivilized world will continue to reject and condemn\nsuch a move by Israel. It is regrettable that the United\nStates, last week, once again and for the thirty-sixth\ntime, resorted to the veto to block the adoption of a\ndraft resolution.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, I wish to take this\nopportunity to express our satisfaction over the steady\nimprovement of the situation in Afghanistan under the\nleadership of President Karzai and his Government. At\nthe same time, we are concerned about problems such\nas the regrouping of remnants of the Taliban and Al\nQaeda, the paucity of international assistance and the\nincrease in opium poppy cultivation. Unless the\ninternational community is more forthcoming in\nassisting the Afghan people and Government, recent\nachievements in Afghanistan may be jeopardized.\nWe have a great stake in the return of full\nnormality and stability to Afghanistan. In this area, we\nhave strongly supported the central role of the United\nNations in helping the Afghans to rebuild their own\ncountry, and we believe that the United Nations should\ncontinue to play this role for the foreseeable future.\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon that requires a\nglobal response. Fighting terrorism requires a\nmultifaceted approach that goes well beyond a simple\nfocus on law and order and also addresses its\nunderlying causes. A unilateral and one-dimensional\napproach, based merely on the use of force, may\nneutralize some threats and bring some psychological\ncomfort to those who seek revenge in response to\n29\n \nterrorist acts, but few would regard that as a serious\nmethods of uprooting international terrorism.\nAny attempt to link terrorism to a specific\nreligion or culture is prejudicial, politically motivated\nand thus unacceptable. No religion authorizes its\nadherents to kill innocent people, whatever the\nobjective of such acts might be.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran condemns terrorism\nin all its forms and manifestations. Iran has done more\nthan its fair share to effectively combat terrorism. In\nthe heat of the military intervention in Afghanistan and\nin the wake of the Taliban collapse, thousands of\nindividuals were denied entry into Iran; more than\n2,300 individuals with false or no travel documents\nwere deported and hundreds of suspects were arrested,\ninterrogated and handed over to their countries of\nnationality or residence; and lists of such persons were\nbrought to the attention of the relevant United Nations\nofficials and bodies. Iran continues to cooperate in\nserious and long-term efforts to combat terrorism in a\ncomprehensive, non-discriminatory and non-selective\nmanner   efforts that do not pick and choose between\ngood and bad, or useful, terrorists.\nWeapons of mass destruction are among the most\npotent threats to peace and security at the regional and\nglobal levels. The Chemical Weapons Convention,\nBiological Weapons Convention and the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are the\nresults of our collective wisdom in our efforts to\neliminate the threat of chemical and biological\nweapons and the spread of nuclear weapons. We\nbelieve that more needs to be done. We should do more\nto make these basic international instruments universal.\nWe should also do more to strengthen verification of\ntheir implementation. Finally, we should all work\ncollectively, as mandated by the International Court of\nJustice, to move towards the total elimination of\nnuclear weapons.\nBy adhering to all of these three instruments as an\noriginal party, my country has shown its determination\nto work towards the complete eradication of weapons\nof mass destruction from the Earth. Our commitment to\ninternational regimes on weapons of mass destruction\nlies not merely in our contractual obligations but, more\nimportantly, in our religious convictions and historical\nexperience. No country has suffered as acutely as mine\nfrom the tragic scars left from being victims of such\nweapons, particularly against the backdrop of a\ncomplacent international environment. We are\nconvinced that the pursuit of nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction will not only fail to\nprovide deterrence or enhance security and influence,\nbut will only increase vulnerability. Thus, I can state\ncategorically that for all these reasons, weapons of\nmass destruction have no place in the defensive\nstrategy of my country. We believe the only option is to\nwork actively towards a global and regional ban on\nthese weapons, and we have thus spared no effort in\nthis regard.\nHowever, the efforts to ban, or strengthen the\nban, on weapons of mass destruction should not\nprovide any excuse for denying States the right to\ndevelop technology for peaceful purposes.\nUnfortunately, the political pressure against the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to relinquish its inalienable right to\ndevelop peaceful nuclear technology is mounting,\nwhile some nuclear weapon States continue to test and\ndevelop advanced tactical nuclear weapons\nprogrammes. Furthermore, in defiance of international\ncalls to adhere to the NPT, Israel is continuing, with\nimpunity, its clandestine development of sophisticated\nnuclear weapons and their delivery systems. All NPT\nReview and Extension conferences have called for the\nsuspension and freezing of Israel's tactical weapons\nand nuclear programmes, which are the real threats to\ninternational peace and security. They are both\nconsidered to be in contravention with the letter and\nspirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nIran's nuclear programme is solely for peaceful\npurposes, specifically for the planned production of\n7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 for Iran's\neconomic development. Iran will vigorously pursue its\npeaceful nuclear programme and will not give in to\nunreasonable, discriminatory and selective demands\nthat go beyond the requirements of non-proliferation\nunder existing International Atomic Energy Agency\ninstruments. At the same time, Iran does not have a\nnuclear weapons programme, nor does it intend to\nembark on one. Thus, we have nothing to hide, and in\nprinciple have no problem with the Additional Protocol.\nWe are eager to ensure that this step will be utilized\nsolely to enhance confidence and remove all doubts\nabout the peaceful nature of our nuclear programme.\n\n\n \nIn facing global challenges, no possibility other\nthan mutual cooperation through the United Nations\nwill be conducive to lasting and effective solutions.\nThe democratic process advocated at all levels within\nthe international community needs also to be reflected\nwithin the United Nations system. The General\nAssembly should play a more active role in global\naffairs. A more representative and democratic Security\nCouncil would mean a more efficient United Nations\n  the kind of organization we should all want and\nwork for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\ufeffMr. President, we\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of\nthe fifty-eighth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. We wish you every success in our shared\nendeavours. You will have our fullest cooperation in\nyour efforts.\nAs we gather here, in the wake of the many\nmomentous events over the past year, it is inevitable\nthat we should ponder some fundamental questions\nabout the role and relevance of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations was charged by its Charter\n\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar.\u201d The Charter also speaks of our collective\ndetermination \u201cto unite our strength to maintain\ninternational peace and security.\u201d There was an implicit\nconviction that the United Nations would be stronger\nthan the sum of its constituent Member States. Its\nunique legitimacy flows from a universal perception\nthat it pursues a larger purpose than the interests of one\ncountry or a small group of countries.\nThis vision of an enlightened multilateralism has\nnot materialized. There have been difficulties and\ndeficiencies in ensuring a world free from strife, a world\nwithout war. The United Nations has not always been\nsuccessful in preventing conflicts or in resolving them.\nDuring the past year, the United Nations\nencountered new challenges. We saw the extraordinary\ninability of the five permanent members of the Security\nCouncil to agree on action in respect of Iraq, in spite of\ncomplete agreement on basic objectives. Most recently,\nthe brutal terrorist attack on the United Nations Office\nin Baghdad struck a body blow at the United Nations\u2019\nhumanitarian efforts there.\nLooking back at events over recent years, we can\nanalyse the successes and failures of the United\nNations in this or that crisis. But it would be more\npurposeful to reflect on our own commitment to\nmultilateralism, the extent of its applicability in the\nreal world of today, and the manner in which it can be\nexercised through the United Nations. The reality is\nthat an international institution like the United Nations\ncan only be as effective as its Members allow it to be.\nOur reflections on the United Nations should\nfocus on three key aspects:\nFirst, we need to introspect on some of the\nassumptions that have been made over the years\nconcerning the will and reach of the United Nations. In\nthe euphoria after the Cold War, there was a misplaced\nnotion that the United Nations could solve every\nproblem anywhere. Its enthusiasm and proactive stance\non many issues reflected laudable intentions. But we\nsoon realized that the United Nations does not possess\nmagical powers to solve every crisis in all parts of the\nglobe or to change overnight the motivation of leaders\nand communities around the world. \/\/We need to\nclearly recognize, with a sense of realism, the limits to\nwhat the United Nations can achieve, and the changes\nof form and function required for it to play an optimal\nrole in today\u2019s world. We need to clearly recognize,\nwith a sense of realism, the limits to what the United\nNations can achieve, and the changes that it needs to\nmake to its form and function to play an optimal role in\ntoday\u2019s world.\nSecondly, the Iraq issue has inevitably generated\na debate on the functioning and the efficacy of the\nSecurity Council and of the United Nations itself. Over\nthe decades, the United Nations membership has grown\nenormously. The scope of its activities has expanded\ngreatly, with new specialized agencies and new\nprogrammes. But in the political and security\ndimensions of its activities, the United Nations has not\nkept pace with the changes in the world. For the\nSecurity Council to represent genuine multilateralism\nin its decisions and actions, its membership must\nreflect current world realities. Most United Nations\nMembers today recognize the need for an enlarged and\nrestructured Security Council, with more developing\ncountries as permanent and non-permanent members.\nThe permanent members guard their exclusivity. Some\nStates with weak claims want to ensure that others do\nnot enter the Council as permanent members. This\ncombination of complacency and negativism has to be\ncountered with a strong political will. The recent crises\nshould serve as a warning to us that until the Security\nCouncil is reformed and restructured, its decisions\ncannot truly reflect the collective will of the\ncommunity of nations.\nThirdly, even after such reform, the Security\nCouncil would have to develop suitable decision-\nmaking mechanisms that ensure better representation of\nthe collective will of the international community. How\ncan multilateralism be genuinely implemented? A\nsingle veto is an anachronism in today\u2019s world. On the\nother hand, the requirement of unanimity can sabotage\nimperative actions. A simple-majority vote may not be\n15\n \nsufficiently representative for major and serious issues.\nShould we aim for the highest common factor, or\nshould we settle for the lowest common denominator?\nDemocratic countries could use their national\nexperience to provide feasible models for mechanisms\nand determine the extent of support required based on\nthe impact of action to be taken.\nThe Secretary-General has rightly emphasized the\nurgent need for reform of the institutions and processes\nof the United Nations. We encourage his efforts in this\ndirection. We should seek to implement these reforms\nwithin a specified time frame.\nThe Iraq issue continues to present a major\nchallenge to the United Nations. At this point in time,\nit is not very productive to linger on the past. Our\nthoughts and concerns should be about the suffering of\nthe people of Iraq. It is imperative that the people of\nIraq should be empowered to determine their own\nfuture and to rebuild their nation.\nThe immediate priorities are ensuring security\nand stability, restoration of basic facilities and\ninfrastructure and a road map of political processes for\na representative Iraqi Government. It is clear that the\nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in the process\nof political and economic reconstruction of that\ncountry. This has been acknowledged both by those\nwho had opposed military action and by those who did\nnot seek specific United Nations endorsement for it.\nOne issue on which the United Nations showed\nremarkable unanimity after 11 September was global\nterrorism. Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001)\nand 1456 (2003) were unequivocal in condemning all\nforms of terrorism and in calling for united action\nagainst support, shelter, sponsorship, arming, training\nand financing of terrorism or terrorists.\nUnfortunately, the solidarity that was voiced has\nnot translated into coherent and effective action.\nTerrorist acts continue to shatter our peace, from\nMombasa to Moscow and from Baghdad to Bali. India\nhas had more than its share of terrorism in various\nparts of the country. The global coalition against\nterrorism has registered successes in Afghanistan, but\nhas not been able to extend this elsewhere. Some of its\nmembers are themselves part of the problem. We are\nsometimes led to enter into semantic arguments over\nthe definition of terrorism. The search for root causes\nor imaginary freedom struggles provides alibis for\nkilling innocent men, women and children.\nThere is much that the United Nations can do to\ncarry forward the war against international terrorism.\nThe Counter-Terrorism Committee should develop\nmeasures to ensure compliance by Member States of\ntheir obligations under Security Council resolutions\n1373 (2001) and 1456 (2003). We should have credible\nmultilateral instruments to identify States that\ncontravene these resolutions. Multilateral mechanisms\nmust be created to detect and choke off international\nfinancial flows to terrorists and terrorist organizations.\nA much better international system of\ninformation exchange and intelligence sharing needs to\nbe devised to prevent terrorists from evading capture\nsimply by crossing national borders. No State should\nbe allowed to profess partnership with the global\ncoalition against terror, while continuing to aid, abet\nand sponsor terrorism. To condone such double\nstandards is to contribute to multiplying terrorism.\nYesterday, the President of Pakistan chose this\naugust Assembly to make a public admission for the\nfirst time that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in\nJammu and Kashmir. After claiming that there is an\nindigenous struggle in Kashmir, he has offered to\nencourage a general cessation of violence within Kashmir,\nin return for reciprocal obligations and restraints.\nWe totally refuse to let terrorism become a tool of\nblackmail. Just as the world did not negotiate with al\nQaeda or the Taliban, we shall not negotiate with\nterrorism. Were we to do so, we would be betraying the\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, who defied a most\nferocious campaign of violence and intimidation\nsponsored from across our borders and participated in\nan election, which has been universally hailed as free\nand fair. This was an unequivocal expression of both\ndetermination and self-determination.\nWhen the cross-border terrorism stops, or when\nwe eradicate it, we can have a dialogue with Pakistan\non the other issues between us.\nWhile on this subject, I would also like to point\nout to the President of Pakistan that he should not\nconfuse the legitimate aspiration for equality of nations\nwith outmoded concepts of military parity.\nWe should be particularly concerned at the\nvarious recent revelations about clandestine transfers of\nweapons of mass destruction and their technologies.\nWe face the frightening prospect of these weapons and\ntechnologies falling into the hands of terrorists. Surely\n16\n \nsomething needs to be done about the helplessness of\ninternational regimes in preventing such transactions,\nwhich clearly threaten international security. The same\nregimes expend considerable energy in imposing a\nvariety of discriminatory technology-denial restrictions\non responsible States.\nOur preoccupation with terrorism should not\ndilute our commitment to tackle the non-military\nthreats to human and international security. We have to\nsustain the fight against trafficking in narcotic drugs,\nhuman beings and small arms, the pandemic of\nHIV\/AIDS, diseases like malaria and tuberculosis that\nbeset developing countries and the degradation of our\ncommon environment. Food security, energy security\nand health security are important goals.\nThe countries of the North and of the South \u2014\nthe developed, developing and transition economies \u2014\nmust resume their dialogue to build a better world for\nthe present and future generations. For the agenda of\nglobalization, Canc\u00fan was a disappointment.\nSignificant progress was made at Johannesburg\ntowards the realization of sustainable development, but\nthe entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on climate\nchange remains stalled and the Convention on\nBiological Diversity has not yielded any tangible\nbenefits to the world\u2019s poor.\nInternational economic relations continue to be\ncharacterized by inequities and inequalities.\nGlobalization has helped sections of the international\neconomy, including some developing countries; however,\nlarge communities have been left outside its pale. It has\nengendered economic crises and instability in several\ndeveloping countries and sharply increased poverty.\nPoverty is multidimensional. It extends beyond\nmoney and income to education, health care, skills\nenhancement, political participation at all levels from\nthe local to the global, access to natural resources,\nclean water and air, and advancement of one\u2019s own\nculture and social organization.\nPoverty alleviation requires resources on a far\ngreater scale than now available. Globalization itself\nplaces constraints on Governments of developing\ncountries in raising public resources for poverty\nalleviation. The promise of the climate change and\nbiodiversity treaties to raise significant resources for\ninvestment and technology transfer is as yet unrealized.\nThe resources of multilateral and bilateral development\nagencies are limited by the failure of industrialized\ncountries to enhance development budgets.\nTherefore, if the current regimes of globalization\nand sustainable development are to be expanded \u2014 or\neven to survive \u2014 they must be directly harnessed to\nprovide the necessary resources for poverty alleviation.\nIn fact, all international agreements and initiatives\naffecting developing countries have to be evaluated by\ntheir impact on poverty.\nDeveloping countries need to coordinate their\npositions in international negotiations to promote the\nadoption of regimes which would help alleviate\npoverty. The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue\nForum, which was established earlier this year, is an\neffort in this direction.\nWe in the developing countries do not have the\nluxury of time. Political compulsions force us to meet\nthe aspirations of our people quickly, even as we\nsubject ourselves to newer and more rigid international\nstandards and norms. We owe it to our future generations\nto make strong efforts to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. There is a mutuality of interest in\nthis between the developed and the developing\ncountries. Global interdependence today means that\neconomic disasters in developing countries could\ncreate a backlash in developed countries. We hope the\nworld will act in this spirit of enlightened self-interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I\nam pleased to express to you, Sir, and to your friendly\ncountry, Gabon, our sincere congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session. We are confident that you will lead\nthe work of this session in a highly capable and\nefficient manner. I should also like to express our\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, who, as\nPresident of the last session of the Assembly, managed\nits affairs with wisdom and skill.\nOn this occasion, I should like to convey the deep\nappreciation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his sustained,\ndiligent and commendable efforts to maintain\ninternational peace and security and to revitalize the\nrole of the United Nations and enhance its functions,\ncapacities, credibility and effectiveness. In that regard,\nthe speech given by the Secretary-General last week is\nnotable and praiseworthy, as it provided a blueprint and\nguidelines for enhancing the resiliency of the\ninternational order. It is crucial when tackling global\nissues to bridge the gaps in the international order so\nthat measures are not applied selectively or arbitrarily.\nThe accelerating global changes and the grave\nchallenges facing the international community today\nnecessitate more than ever a scrutiny of the working\nmethods of the United Nations, as well as the\nstructures and functions of its organs, in order to\nenhance its ability to prevent and resolve conflicts and\nto maintain international peace and security.\nIn that respect, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nsupports the call for reform of the Security Council, in\nparticular, an increase in its membership in order to\nimprove geographical representation, a greater\ntransparency in its work, a halt to the application of\ndouble standards and the adoption of measures that\nwill enhance the credibility of the Council\u2019s work and\nguarantee respect for, and compliance with, its\nresolutions.\nAmong the important reforms needed in our\nOrganization is restriction of the veto power.\nPermanent members of the Security Council should not\nbe allowed to invoke their right of veto in cases where\nproposed resolutions and procedures are adopted to\nimplement previously agreed resolutions.\nIt is also imperative to establish an optimal\nbalance between the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council, to enhance the role of the Economic\nand Social Council and to establish closer coordination\n18\n\namong the various United Nations funds, programmes\nand activities.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the United\nNations and the multilateral international order. Today,\nmore than ever, the international community is in dire\nneed of a unified and mutually supportive stance in\norder to achieve just solutions to the current problems\nwe all face. It is through respect for the shared values,\ntraditions and principles that are deeply rooted in the\nconscience of all mankind that we can promote\nconstructive cooperation and the achievement of\nsecurity, peace, stability and prosperity for all nations.\nHumanity has been afflicted by the growing\ndanger of terrorism. It is a phenomenon that does not\ndifferentiate between societies. Increasingly, terrorist\ngroups have been crossing borders and expanding their\nnetworks into different regions, nations and continents.\nToday, it is therefore critical that we exert every effort\npossible to increase international cooperation to\ncombat terrorism and confront those who instigate and\nfinance it.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rejects terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations and is cooperating with\nthe international community to eliminate that global\nevil. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has affirmed its full\nsupport for the Security Council resolutions relating to\nterrorism. In that regard, Saudi Arabia has taken the\nnecessary steps to close any loopholes in its domestic\nregulations on charitable fund-raising activities that\nmight allow such funds to be used for illicit purposes.\nWe have established a public commission tasked with\nsupervising and organizing the activities of all\ncharitable and relief organizations with a view to\nstreamlining their operations and preventing those with\nbad intentions and evil objectives from using their\nhumanitarian funds for illegal purposes.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was among the\nfirst signatories of the Arab Convention on the\nSuppression of Terrorism and other similar agreements\nemanating from the Organization of the Islamic\nConference and the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council. In\naddition, it has acceded to nine other international anti-\nterrorism conventions and agreements. In that regard,\nthe Government of Saudi Arabia has recently taken a\nseries of measures that are indicative of its seriousness\nand determination to fight terrorism. Its strategy of\npreventive action to forestall criminal acts has already\nbeen successful in the fight against this deadly scourge\nand has earned the praise and admiration of the\ninternational community and international\norganizations.\nIt is important to remember that crimes\ncommitted by a handful of criminals and misguided\nfelons cannot justify incriminating a whole society or\nan entire culture. Terrorism can strike any city and\ntarget any interests, regardless of the nationality,\nreligion or ethnic origin of the victims. Terrorism is a\nglobal phenomenon that calls for joint action and\ncooperation by all countries and requires the close\ncollaboration of concerned international organizations\nto effectively find the means to confront it and\neliminate it.\nIt is on the basis of the foregoing that I am\npleased to announce before this gathering that the\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has\ndecided to host an international conference to combat\nterrorism, to be held in Riyadh from 5 to 8 February\n2005. Its purpose is to exchange information and\nexperience in the field of combating terrorism and to\nsee how we can cooperate with other countries in the\nfight against that universal threat. We also intend to use\nthis excellent opportunity to learn about scientific and\npractical techniques relevant not only to combating\nterrorism, but also to the prevention of money-\nlaundering, drug trafficking and arms smuggling. The\nconference will also provide a good forum in which to\nstudy the culture and psychology of terrorists and the\nstructure of terrorist organizations.\nOfficial invitations to the anti-terrorism\nconference have already been extended to concerned\ninternational organizations as well as to countries that\nhave suffered or are suffering from terrorism. The\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the participation\nof all those invited and hopes that the outcome and\nfinal recommendations of the conference will\nconstitute an important addition and a great support to\ninternational efforts to eradicate terrorism and address\nthe root causes of that dangerous phenomenon.\nThe setback in the peace process and the\nmounting wave of violence and extremism in our\nregion are largely attributable to the Israeli\nGovernment\u2019s pursuit of policies that are totally\nincompatible with the fundamental principles of the\npeace process, notably the principle of land for peace.\nIsrael\u2019s actions are in contravention of Security Council\nresolutions \u2014 in particular, resolutions 242 (1967) and\n19\n\n338 (1973) \u2014 and the road map. They are incompatible\nwith the United States Administration\u2019s vision of two\nStates \u2014 an Israeli State and an independent\nPalestinian State \u2014 living side by side.\nThe Arab peace initiative continues to stand as a\ncredible basis for the security and stability of all the\npeoples of the region because it ensures a lasting, just\nand comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli\nconflict. It is therefore incumbent upon all of us to\nexert our utmost efforts to put the peace process back\non track. It is particularly important to push the peace\nprocess forward after it has stalled and after the\nhumanitarian plight of the Palestinian people \u2014 which\nshould be a goad to the conscience of the international\ncommunity \u2014 has been met with indifference.\nFurthermore, peace cannot be achieved by\nunilateral Israeli measures that create new realities on\nthe ground and that are designed to prejudice the final\noutcome of any political negotiations on the delicate\nissue of a final settlement. The Palestinian question\ncannot be solved, nor can the Arab-Israeli conflict be\nended, through the use of excessive force \u2014 aerial\nbombardment, guided missiles, assassination of\nPalestinian activists, destruction of infrastructure,\nusurpation of property, violation of rights and the\nimposition of collective punishment. Peace will be\nachieved and security will prevail only when United\nNations resolutions are implemented, the provisions of\ninternational law are respected and applied and the\nprinciples of justice and equality are observed.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns the\ncontinuous escalation against the Palestinian people\nand the Israeli Government\u2019s insistence on establishing\nand expanding its settlements. We also condemn the\ncontinued construction of the separation wall that has\nannexed extensive Palestinian lands in unprecedented\ndefiance of the advisory opinion of the International\nCourt of Justice, which acknowledged the illegality of\nthe wall and ordered Israel to dismantle it, as well as\nthe General Assembly resolution that followed that\nopinion, effectively demonstrating the consensus of the\ninternational community on the issue.\nHowever, if Israel is serious about withdrawing\nfrom Gaza and about dismantling its settlements there,\nwe stress that such an action should proceed in\ncoordination with the Palestinian Authority, in\nconformity with the requirements of the road map and\nunder the supervision of the Quartet. The proposed\nwithdrawal should come about as a first step towards a\ncomplete and full withdrawal from all the Palestinian\nlands, including Al-Quds.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely\nmonitoring efforts to eliminate all forms of weapons of\nmass destruction from the Middle East and to keep it\nfree from all such lethal weapons. In that respect, we\ncall upon the international community to adopt an\neven-handed approach, refrain from applying double\nstandards, assume its legal and moral responsibilities\nand urge the Israeli Government to refrain from the\ndevelopment of its nuclear programmes, as well as\nsubject its nuclear installations to the inspection and\nsafeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency.\nWe are profoundly distressed and gravely\nconcerned at the deteriorating security situation in\nsome parts of Iraq, where tragic incidents, heinous acts\nof violence, and the horrific kidnapping of innocent\npeople seem to be daily occurrences. Faced with this\nappalling reality, we can only urge the Iraqi people and\nall Iraqi factions to mend fences and work hand in\nhand to support the efforts of their transitional\nGovernment to establish the security, safety and well-\nbeing of their country; preserve its national unity and\nindependence and ensure the restoration of Iraq\u2019s\neffective and positive role in the international arena.\nWe also call upon the United Nations to play a greater\nrole in assisting the Iraqi Government to meet the\nrequirements of the ongoing political process,\nincluding by conducting general elections, which we\nhope will lead to a permanent legitimate Government,\nand proceeding with reconstruction efforts.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has presented\nsome ideas regarding the deployment of Islamic troops\nin Iraq. With the consent of the Iraqi Government and\nunder United Nations supervision, we would like such\ntroops not to supplement, but to replace, the\nmultilateral forces. Those ideas, however, have not\nmaterialized, although their basic premise deserves\nconsideration and follow-up.\nWith respect to developments in the brotherly\ncountry of the Sudan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is\nprofoundly moved by the humanitarian tragedy in\nDarfur and supports the efforts of the Government of\nthe Sudan to restore stability in that region. We support\nthe Sudan\u2019s cooperation with relief and humanitarian\norganizations and others in addressing the\n20\n\nhumanitarian situation resulting from the crisis. We\nhope that the efforts of the Government of the Sudan\nand those of the African Union will be given sufficient\ntime to restore security to the region and to ensure the\nwell-being of its people.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has initiated an\nongoing airlift operation, using Saudi cargo planes, to\nprovide direct humanitarian assistance to the Darfur\nregion. This assistance includes medical and food\nsupplies, tents and power generators. Moreover, there\nare Saudi relief teams in the region who have\nestablished clinics and hospitals inside camps and\nequipped them with doctors, medicine, medical\nsupplies and tests. In addition, wells have been dug to\nprovide the camps with drinking water, and electricity\nis being supplied.\nHuman development and economic prosperity are\nmajor keys to achieving a better future for developing\ncountries. To reach that objective, developed and\ndeveloping nations can work together to achieve great\nsuccess. My country has contributed to this process by\nadopting and implementing numerous development\nprojects and by extending generous assistance to\ndeveloping and least developed countries through\nnational, regional and international agencies, in order\nto help them in overcoming the problems of poverty\nand underdevelopment.\nWe appreciate the concern expressed by the\nGroup of Eight at their summit in Sea Island, Georgia,\nin the United States, regarding the future of the Middle\nEast and their desire to help the countries of the region\ndevelop and make progress. However, we believe that\npolitical and economic reforms should not be imposed\nor dictated from outside; rather, international assistance\nin this area should serve as a catalyst to help these\nnations initiate their own reforms. Outside interference\non the question of reform can only result in disrupting\nand stalling processes that are already under way.\nFor reforms to be effective and lasting, they\nshould reflect the actual needs of the societies\nconcerned and should conform with a given State\u2019s\nstage of development. Of course, there is much that the\nadvanced countries can do to help in this process,\nespecially in the areas of investment, trade\nliberalization, international economic cooperation and\nthe opening of their markets. We believe that removing\nprotective measures, such as trade barriers and tariffs,\nand eliminating preferential treatment that hinders the\nability of developing countries to enter the markets of\ndeveloped countries can go far in achieving desired\ndevelopment goals. There is, moreover, a need to make\nthe necessary effort to help those countries to\novercome their problems and their chronic political\nconflicts.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, based on its\nposition of responsibility and its effective role in the\ninternational oil market, has consistently sought to\nmeet its obligations to maintain stable oil markets and\nensure continuing world economic growth. To that end,\nit has increased its production capacity to ensure\nsufficient supply and to control unnatural oil price\nsurges.\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took\nthe initiative of establishing the International Energy\nForum and hosting its general secretariat in Riyadh.\nThe Forum has become a platform for discussing ways\nand means of cooperation and dialogue between\nconsumer and producer countries, whether within or\noutside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC). Those countries should seek to\nintensify their cooperation in order to ensure stable\nmarkets for the strategic commodity of petroleum, and\nto guarantee the continued growth of the global\neconomy.\nIn view of the tragic security events on the\ninternational scene, the world needs, more than ever,\nconcerted international efforts to increase dialogue and\nraise the level of understanding, mutual contact and\nfamiliarity among nations and cultures. The world\nneeds to embark on a serious effort to propagate a\nculture of peace, in order to achieve for our fellow\nhuman beings the dignity and prosperity they deserve.\nWe need to do more to put an end to the wave of\nviolence and work for the achievement of justice and\nthe termination of racial discrimination.\nGod Almighty said in the Holy Qur\u2019an: \u201cO\nmankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male\nand a female, And made you into Nations and tribes,\nthat ye may know each other. Verily the most honoured\nof you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most\nrighteous of you.\u201d",

        "text": "It is with\npleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nassumption of the presidency at the fifty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly.\nIt is also a pleasure to speak to the Assembly\ntoday as the Prime Minister of a fully sovereign State\nthat seeks to recover its place among the community of\nnations. Iraq has been isolated from the international\ncommunity for a very long time. It was deprived of the\nvery important role it should play in the community of\nnations. The Iraqi people aspire to recover that role\ntoday.\nIraq is a nation rich in cultural heritage and\nhistory, as the cradle of civilization. But the oppressive\nregime of Saddam Hussein cast a long, sinister shadow\nover Iraq. It traumatized and suppressed the people of\nIraq for decades. With the fall of Saddam Hussein\u2019s\n11\n\noppressive regime, our country and the world have\nbeen made safer. New horizons for fruitful and\nconstructive cooperation with the world have emerged.\nA new situation has emerged in Iraq, which is\nnow experiencing a conflict of far-reaching\nconsequences for the country\u2019s future and its relations\nwith the world. It is the struggle of the Iraqi people \u2014\nand its vision for future peace and democracy \u2014\nagainst the terrorists and extremists and the remnants\nof Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, who are targeting that\nnoble dream long nurtured by our people. It is the\nstruggle of all civilized nations against those working\nto destroy civilization and world culture. I therefore\nappeal to the representatives of the countries assembled\nhere to help Iraq to defeat the forces of terrorism and to\nbuild a better future for its people.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nThe brutal dictatorship imposed by Saddam\nHussein on Iraq brought destruction to Iraq and\nbrutalized and traumatized the Iraqi people. The regime\nkilled hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens. It\narrested and tortured many thousands more and drove\nmillions of Iraqis to leave their country after depriving\nthem of the most fundamental human and civil rights.\nIt also ruined relations among Iraqis by sowing the\nseeds of religious, ethnic and other divisions.\nMy words today cannot adequately convey the\noppression and suffering endured by the Iraqi people\nover three decades. We have discovered 262 mass\ngraves, and we continue to find more; they prove the\ncorruption of the Saddam regime and its lack of\ncompassion and respect for life.\nDuring the brutal era of Saddam Hussein, the\ndream of the Iraqi people was to build a democratic,\nfederal and free Iraq that would ensure a dignified life\nfor its citizens. Today, we have a genuine opportunity\nto make that dream come true. Iraq has now become a\ncountry of laws that ensure respect for human rights\nand freedoms. It has a Government that embodies the\ndiversity of the Iraqi people within the framework of\ngenuine national unity.\nToday, we are also preparing to hold democratic\nelections next January under the timeline set in the\nLaw of Administration of the State of Iraq for the\nTransitional Period and in Security Council resolution\n1546 (2004). We are committed to that timeline despite\nthe complexities and difficulties involved, and, with\nthe Assembly\u2019s help, we can meet the deadline.\nHolding elections is a vital and necessary step towards\nimproving the security situation in Iraq. We hope that\nall Iraqis will participate in the elections and contribute\nto the completion of the political process.\nNonetheless, there is a tiny extremist minority\nthat seeks to deprive Iraqis of the opportunity to fulfil\ntheir dream of building a democratic future in Iraq.\nLike all terrorists everywhere in the world, those who\nare responsible for terrorism in Iraq hate democracy,\nfreedom and humanity. They are abetted in their\ncriminal endeavours by a number of foreigners who\nhave infiltrated Iraq from neighbouring countries.\nThere are also criminals from the previous regime, who\naim at destroying our country and impeding progress.\nThey are not freedom fighters, as is claimed by some\nbiased circles. They do not mean to liberate our\ncountry; rather, they want to spread chaos, violence\nand terror and jeopardize the security of citizens and of\nthe country. They target the dreams and aspirations of\nthe Iraqi people.\nIn fact, our goal in the ongoing conflict is to\nrestore stability and the rule of law and to enable the\nmen, women and children of Iraq to live free from fear.\nThe aim of the terrorists, on the other hand, is to\ndestroy the aspirations and will power of our people\nthrough mass killings and the destruction of Iraq\u2019s\ninfrastructure, and to stop economic life in Iraq and\ncreate a state of tension, panic and instability in order\nto undermine peace and security. They want to destroy\nhuman civilization in our region and, indeed,\nthroughout the world.\nFor all those reasons, my Government\u2019s top\npriorities are to defeat the terrorists\u2019 schemes, to\nestablish security throughout Iraq and to hunt down the\nterrorists and bring them to justice. We have developed\nplans to promote security as a vital precondition for the\nreconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of economic\nprogress, the completion of the political process, the\nachievement of national reconciliation and the\npromotion of a culture of tolerance among all citizens\nof Iraq.\nPerhaps members now appreciate the daunting\ntask we are facing. We look forward to assistance from\nour neighbours and all of our friends in the\ninternational community in order to achieve security\nand stability in Iraq. I recognize that some countries\nhere objected to the war that brought down the\n12\n\noppressive regime of Saddam Hussein and liberated the\npeople of Iraq. And that is their right. However,\ndifferences over this issue should not remain an\nobstacle to establishing new cooperative relationships\nthat would allow Iraq to receive serious international\nsupport to consolidate security, freedom and\ndemocracy in our country and to forge ahead on the\npath of development and progress.\nIraq welcomes international support for the\nobjectives of the Iraqi people as outlined in Security\nCouncil resolution 1546 (2004), which was adopted\nunanimously. That resolution reaffirms the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of Iraq and endorses the\nformation of the national Government. It also affirms\nthe international community\u2019s commitment to support\nthe Government in fulfilling the will of the Iraqi people\nby holding elections and establishing the proper legal\nframework for political parties and civil society. In\naddition, it places emphasis on the re-establishment of\nan effective governmental structure, the application of\nthe principle of social justice, and the promotion of a\nclimate of tolerance, dialogue and human rights.\nWe need more assistance from our neighbours\nand from the international community as a whole to\nmeet all those objectives and to translate the\naspirations of the Iraqi people into realities after so\nmany decades of suffering under the oppression of the\nprevious regime and its excessive practices. We are\nproud of our membership of the League of Arab States,\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and\nwe have started a fruitful dialogue with the European\nUnion. We hope that all that will lead to concrete\npositive results in the near future.\nAlso, I am pleased to announce here that the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreed\nto assist Iraq in the training of its security forces. I\nespecially welcome the upcoming conference of\nneighbouring countries and other friendly countries,\nwith the objective of empowering the Iraqi people to\nface its challenges and dangers and of establishing\nstability in Iraq.\nIt is our duty to coordinate our efforts in the fight\nagainst terrorism and to exchange information. It is\nalso our duty to ensure that our national borders are\nmore secure, so that we can halt the infiltration of\nterrorists into Iraq and put an end to their destructive\nactivities. In that context, we call upon all friendly and\npeace-loving nations to stand by Iraq; we need their\nimmediate assistance. We need more assistance from\nthe multinational force, and we need a broadening of\nthe base of countries contributing troops to that force,\nso that it will be better equipped and more determined\nto confront terrorism and to provide security protection\nfor the United Nations and its agencies when they\nreturn to Iraq.\nMy Government is committed to the\nreconstruction and development of the national\neconomy and is working with the World Bank, the\nUnited Nations system and the International Monetary\nFund to complete the reforms under way and enhance\nIraq\u2019s prospects for welfare and prosperity, so that it\ncan become effective as a trading partner of other\nnations. The problem of foreign debt has emerged as\nthe most serious obstacle on that road. Our debts\namount to billions of dollars, which is beyond our\ncapacity to repay. This places an unjust burden on the\nIraqi people, since those debts arose from the\nprohibitive costs improperly incurred by the former\nregime in its unjustified wars, its support for\ninternational terrorism, its acquisition of weapons of\nmass destruction and its plunder of our national\nresources.\nWith good intentions and rational management,\nIraq hopes to reach agreement with the Paris Club by\nthe end of this year in order to achieve substantial\nreductions in our debts. Here, I would like to express\nour gratitude to those countries that have decided to\nwrite off their loans to Iraq, and I appeal to other\ncreditor nations to show the same generosity. Without\ntheir assistance, we will not be able to reconstruct Iraq\nand attract the foreign investment that would enhance\nour ability to defeat terrorism and improve security for\nthe Iraqi people, ensuring increased economic benefits\nfor the region and entire world. Also, I appeal to donor\ncountries that have pledged generous financial\nassistance to fulfil their obligations in order to help us\nreconstruct our country. We welcome the meeting of\ndonor countries scheduled to be convened next month\nin Tokyo. Such financial assistance will create an\natmosphere of optimism that will allow us to leave the\npast totally behind and will help us finance reforms and\ndevelopment projects on the ground. In addition, we\nhope that Iraq\u2019s friends will provide financial\nassistance to ensure the success of our democratic\nelections.\n13\n\nWe seek international assistance from the United\nNations for the special Iraqi court in order to ensure\nthat all defendants, whatever serious crimes they may\nbe charged with, receive fair trials within the justice\nsystem. That would help Iraq free itself from the\npernicious shackles of the past.\nWe stress that the efforts and resources\ncommitted by the international community to promote\nIraq\u2019s democracy and revive its economy shall not have\nbeen committed in vain. They may even have a\npositive impact on the entire region and the world as a\nwhole, creating a climate conducive to peace, security\nand international and regional cooperation on the basis\nof respect for mutual interests.\nWe highly appreciate the role and good offices of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in helping us lay the\nfoundations of freedom and democracy. We also pay\ntribute to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, former Personal Envoy\nof the Secretary-General, for his work on the\nconstitution of the interim Iraqi Government. We also\nwelcome the appointment of Mr. Ashraf Qazi as\nMr. Brahimi\u2019s successor. We further welcome the\nassistance team dispatched by the United Nations to\nhelp us meet our obligation to convene general\nelections in January.\nWe look forward to welcoming United Nations\npersonnel in Iraq to help see us through an effective\npolitical process and reconstruction. We warmly look\nforward to the return of all United Nations agencies to\nfulfil their noble mission in Iraq.\nOn this occasion, I wish to recall with deep\nanguish and sorrow the destruction of the United\nNations headquarters in Baghdad just over a year ago\nin a brutal and barbaric terrorist attack that claimed the\nlives of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, a brilliant\ninternational figure, and of other United Nations staff\nmembers in the international compound. Their memory\nwill remain a vivid testimony for the promotion of\ndemocracy and stability in Iraq. I stress our\ndetermination to defeat the cowardly terrorists who\ntarget the lives of foreign workers who come to Iraq to\nhelp us fulfil our noble mission.\nIraq follows closely the challenges that face the\ncountries of the world, including the emergence of new\nforms of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, the need to reduce poverty, the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals,\nrespect for human rights and the consolidation of\ndemocracy and equality. In that regard, Iraq appeals to\nthe United Nations in particular to strive even harder,\nto combat and eradicate the horrendous scourge of\nterrorism. That struggle calls for new ideas and firmer\nresolve to implement the existing agreements. It is\nimportant that we affirm the commitment of the\nGovernment and people of Iraq to succeed in this\nbattle.\nTerrorism is a disease that is spreading\nthroughout the world, employing misleading slogans.\nTerrorists have killed numerous people in the name of\nIslam in New York, Turkey, the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia, Bali, Madrid, Baghdad and elsewhere. They\nare criminals who commit their evil acts without mercy\nand evince only a taste for barbarism and bloodshed.\nToday, they have chosen Iraq as their battleground\nbecause they fear the success of the Iraqi experience\nand the restoration of Iraq\u2019s stability, development and\ndemocratic institution-building. They will reap nothing\nbut failure and total defeat.\nThus, our struggle is the United Nations struggle,\nour victory will be its victory and our defeat will be its\ndefeat. Indeed, the values of democracy, freedom,\njustice and equality for all, irrespective of gender,\ncolour, faith or race, are common human values. There\nis no room or excuse for those who seek to divide our\nworld by making a distinction of Muslims, which is\nextremely damaging to the unity of human society,\npeace and security.\nFurthermore, we believe in the importance of\nconsolidating peace and stability in the Middle East on\nthe basis of United Nations resolutions, of respect for\nmutual rights and of a just and comprehensive peace.\nLet me appeal today before the international\ncommunity, both to those who supported the war in\nIraq and to those who opposed it, as well as to the\nUnited Nations itself, not to remain neutral or idle in\nthe struggle, but to join us for our sake as well as for\ntheir own. The fulfilment of the Iraqi people\u2019s dream of\na free, stable and prosperous Iraq, with good standing\nin the family of peace-loving nations, will strengthen\nour capacity and resolve to achieve justice and peace,\nto defeat terrorism and violence, and to end all forms\nof division and hatred among nations. Let us stand side\nby side as one international family in order to achieve\nour noble cause.",

        "text": "I\noffer my warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-ninth session. I am confident that under your\npresidency fruitful results will be achieved. I also wish\nto pay a cordial tribute to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\nsession, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\nThe recent appalling terror in Beslan, Russia,\ncaused massive casualties, including many children.\nOn behalf of the Chinese Government, I strongly\ncondemn, once again, that inhuman act of terrorist\nviolence and extend our deep condolences to the\nfamilies of the victims.\nPeace and development remain the dominant\nthemes in today\u2019s world. Multipolarization and\neconomic globalization are moving forward in twists\nand turns. Science and technology are advancing at a\ndizzying speed. Forces that make for peace and factors\nthat lead to war are both on the rise. Human society is\nmoving in a bright, progressive and positive direction.\nHowever, the light of peace has not fallen on\nevery corner of the globe, nor has development reached\nevery inch of the Earth. Threats to security, both\ntraditional and non-traditional, are intertwined. The\ndark cloud of war remains menacing. Hot spots keep\nspringing up. Terrorist activities are raging, and cross-\nborder problems such as the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction, drug trafficking, transnational\ncrime and illegal immigration are erupting one after\nanother. Factors of uncertainty, instability and\nunpredictability are increasing.\nIn the course of economic globalization, the gap\nbetween the North and the South is widening.\nDeveloping countries are confronting new difficulties\nand challenges as a growing number of them are\nfurther marginalized. Today, half the global population\nlives on less than $2 a day, and of those, 1.2 billion live\non less than $1 a day. Much remains to be done to\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals.\nPeace, development and cooperation are the\nprerequisites for our times. People all over the world\nare raising their voice in favour of peace, development\nand cooperation and against war, poverty and\nconfrontation. Peace is the precondition for human\ndevelopment and prosperity. Without a peaceful and\nstable international environment, development is out of\nthe question for any country. A chaotic world benefits\nno one. Having experienced the scourge of two world\nwars, mankind would not tolerate any more war or\nbloodshed. Thus it is the fervent aspiration of all\npeoples to live and achieve development in a secure\nand stable environment.\nIn tackling security issues, it is imperative to\nfoster a new security concept of mutual trust, mutual\nbenefit, equality and cooperation. This new concept\ncalls for nations to transcend their differences in\nideology and social systems, respect one another\u2019s\nsecurity interests, promote greater democracy in\ninternational relations and seek peaceful solutions to\ndisputes through dialogue.\nTerrorism is the common enemy of the whole\nworld. China stands firmly opposed to terrorism in all\nforms and manifestations. To prevent and fight\nterrorism, we must intensify international cooperation\nand address both the causes and symptoms of the\nthreat. Only when the root causes of terrorism are\neradicated can peoples live in peace and tranquillity\nagain.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nposes a threat to world peace and security. Non-\nproliferation efforts therefore require the participation\nof all members of the international community.\nLikewise, it is important to discard unilateralism and\ndouble standards and to give full credit and full latitude\nto the role of the United Nations.\nChina takes an active part in multilateral non-\nproliferation efforts and firmly defends the\ninternational regime of arms control, disarmament and\nnon-proliferation treaties. China believes that\nmultilateral arms control, disarmament and non-\nproliferation processes can be steadily promoted in\norder to further improve the international non-\nproliferation regime.\nThere is still a long way to go before peace and\nreconstruction can be realized in Iraq. We support an\nimportant role for the United Nations in Iraq\u2019s political\nprocess, helping that country achieve the smooth\nholding of elections.\n10\n\nWe appeal to Palestine and Israel to resume\ndialogue as soon as possible and to start implementing\nthe Middle East road map faithfully. As always, China\nwill work to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean\nPeninsula through dialogue and talks, in the interest of\npeace and stability on the Peninsula.\nDevelopment is the foundation for human\nprogress. Lasting peace and stability throughout the\nworld depends on coordinated, balanced and universal\ndevelopment. Development is of overriding\nimportance. Living in peace, abundance and harmony\nbetween nations has been the dream of many\ngenerations. Coordinated, balanced and sustainable\ndevelopment serves the fundamental interests of all\npeoples and works for their well-being.\nIn order to promote economic growth worldwide,\nit is necessary for the international community to take\neffective measures to put in place an open and fair\nmultilateral trading regime and gradually improve it. It\nis also important to reform and improve the\ninternational financial system.\nThe developed countries must honour their\ncommitments to debt reduction, technology transfer\nand market access through concrete actions in order to\nenable developing countries to really benefit from\nglobalization. The developing countries, for their part,\nneed to work together to attain development and take\npart in a wide range of international efforts. They\nshould also deepen South-South cooperation.\nWe, the members of the international community,\nshould join hands in working for a just and equitable\nnew international economic order that meets the needs\nof the growing economic globalization and serves the\ncommon interests of all countries.\nThe Millennium Development Goals are our\nsolemn, collective pledge. The United Nations should\nfurther mobilize resources, strengthen coordination and\nincrease its input to development activities in order to\nhelp Member States achieve these important goals as\nscheduled.\nCooperation is an effective way of dealing with\nthe collective challenges facing humankind. To\nstrengthen international cooperation, we must\nchampion multilateralism. The United Nations is the\ncentre of the international multilateral system and the\nkey platform for making multilateralism work. It is the\nwidespread desire of the international community to\nadhere to the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter, take more collective actions,\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations and safeguard\nits authority.\nThe threats and challenges we face make it\nimperative to strengthen, rather than weaken, the role\nof the United Nations. A stronger United Nations is\nindispensable for maintaining global peace and\nstability and promoting the common development of\nhumankind. All Member States should honour their\ncommitments to the Charter of the United Nations and\nfulfil their international responsibilities and\nobligations.\nThe world is eagerly looking forward to a\ndynamic and action-oriented United Nations. China\nsupports necessary and rational reforms of the\nOrganization. Such reforms should aim at enhancing\nthe leading role of the United Nations in international\naffairs, reinforcing its capacity to tackle new threats\nand challenges, and ensuring that better reflects the\naspirations and needs of the vast majority of\ndeveloping countries.\nChina is in favour of expanding the Security\nCouncil and of giving priority to greater representation\nof the developing countries. China also supports the\nwork of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges\nand Change, and it is looking forward to the Panel\u2019s\nreport by the end of this year, so that it can be reviewed\nby Member States.\nChina is a staunch force working for world peace,\ncommon development and international cooperation.\nAfter over half a century of strenuous efforts and more\nthan two decades of reform and opening up, China has\nnow entered a new stage of development aimed at\nbuilding a moderately prosperous society all-round.\nHowever, China is still a developing country, and a\nlarge population and inadequate economic\ndevelopment remain its basic national conditions. It\nhas a long way to go before achieving its development\ngoals.\nThe Chinese Government will always place\ndevelopment at the top of its agenda. The fact that\nChina \u2014 a large, developing country with 1.3 billion\npeople \u2014 runs its own affairs well is in itself a major\ncontribution to peace and to the development of\nhumanity.\n11\n\nChina desires peace, development and\ncooperation, and strives to win peace and development\nthrough cooperation. It is working to promote\ndemocracy in international relations, diversity in its\nmodes of development and richness in the world\u2019s\ncivilizations. It advocates a new security concept and\nfacilitates the establishment of a fair and equitable new\ninternational order.\nChina will pursue with determination an\nindependent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the five\nprinciples for Peaceful Coexistence, and engage in\nmutually beneficial and friendly cooperation with other\ncountries on an equal footing.\nChina will unswervingly safeguard its\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, brook no\ninterference in its internal affairs by foreign forces and,\nat the same time, respect other countries\u2019 sovereignty\nand territorial integrity.\nChina remains committed to the common\ninterests of humankind. China\u2019s national interests, in\nthe final analysis, are consistent with the common\ninterests of all humankind. In handling State-to-State\nrelations, China will safeguard its own interests while\ntaking into account the interests of other countries.\nChina will adhere to the policy of opening up, and\ndevelop economic relations and trade with all other\nnations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\nChina\u2019s development stands in the way of no one,\nnor does it pose any threat to others. China is following\nthe path of peaceful development, seeking an\ninternational environment of peace and stability for its\nown development and promoting world peace and\nprogress through its own prosperity.\nChina is working steadily to develop its relations\nwith the world\u2019s major countries. It will stay\ncommitted to the policy of building friendship and\npartnership with its neighbours and combine stronger\nbilateral friendships with enhanced regional\ncooperation. It will strengthen solidarity and\ncooperation with other developing countries and\nsupport any justified demands or legitimate\npropositions on their part in international affairs. It will\nplay a constructive role in the political, economic,\nsocial, disarmament, arms control and other\nmultilateral fields; safeguard the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the\nuniversally recognized norms governing international\nrelations; and support any consensus that serves the\ncommon interests of all countries.\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.\nSafeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity and realizing complete national reunification\nat an early date is the common will and firm resolve of\nthe 1.3 billion Chinese people. Pursuing the policy of\n\u201cpeaceful reunification and one country, two systems\u201d,\nthe Chinese Government is ready to work tirelessly\ntowards a peaceful reunification with the utmost\nsincerity. We, more than anyone else, want to see a\npeaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. But we\nwill never tolerate Taiwan independence, nor will we\nallow anyone to separate Taiwan from the rest of China\nin any way.\nWe hope that the international community will\nfully recognize the complex and sensitive nature of the\ncurrent situation across the Taiwan Strait and the\nserious threat posed by the separatist activities of the\nTaiwan authorities to the stability of the Taiwan Strait\nand the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. We expect the\nAssembly to continue supporting the Chinese\nGovernment\u2019s efforts for peaceful reunification and to\njoin us in containing pro-independence activities, in the\ninterest of stability in the Strait and of world peace.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As the basic\nguidelines for State-to-State relations, the Five\nPrinciples have withstood the test of half a century and\nremain an irrefutable truth. The Five Principles, which\ninclude peace, development and cooperation, are\nconsistent with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations. They provide guidance\nfor the establishment and development of relations\nbetween countries with identical or different social\nsystems; point to the correct path towards the peaceful\nsettlement of outstanding issues between countries and\ninternational disputes; firmly defend the interests of the\ndeveloping countries; and facilitate the improvement\nand development of North-South relations. The Five\nPrinciples present important ideas that must underpin\nthe establishment of a fair and equitable new\ninternational order.\nChina not only initiated, but has faithfully\nobserved, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.\nGiven the new realities of today, we will continue to\nchampion those Principles and join all the peoples of\n12\n\nthe world in advancing the lofty cause of peace,\ndevelopment and cooperation.",

        "text": "I would\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection. We are pleased that a man of your ability, a\nFrancophone representative of a friendly country, is\ndirecting our proceedings.\nI also wish to warmly applaud our Secretary-\nGeneral. We have heard his message on respect for the\nrule of law. And through the Secretary-General, I wish to\ncommend the entire staff of this institution, here and\neverywhere in the world: their courage and commitment\nare a credit to our ideals and to the organizations they\nserve \u2014 sadly, sometimes at the cost of their own\nlives.\nHow are we to meet the challenges facing the\nworld? That is the question we all keep asking\nourselves, one after another, from this rostrum. And\nhow are we to meet the world\u2019s expectations unless we\nall mobilize? More than ever, the United Nations\nremains the one irreplaceable, legitimate framework\nfor harnessing that mobilization and translating it into\ncollective action.\nWe have much to do: conflicts remain unresolved,\nwhile others are breaking out; poverty is declining all too\nslowly; people are destroyed by wars; refugees are torn\nfrom their land; and the threat of terrorism is not\nfading. Yes, we have much to do. Yes, we have a duty\nto act, and an obligation never to give up.\nThe United Nations is acting \u2014 on all fronts, on\nthe front line. To resolve conflicts and prevent them\nfrom flaring up again, it is present everywhere, on all\ncontinents, in Haiti, Kosovo, the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Afghanistan and many\nother fronts, deploying over 50,000 Blue Helmets. It\nprovides assistance to 17 million people protected by\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees. Through the\nWorld Food Programme, it feeds more than 100 million\nindividuals. And it helps, especially through the United\nNations Development Programme, 170 States or\nterritories to develop.\nUnited Nations activities \u2014 our activities \u2014\ncontinue to expand. Thus, the Organization is called\nupon to be at the centre of the counter-terrorism\nmeasures that the international community is putting in\nplace. The threat of terrorism, now a global one,\ncalling for a global response. That is why France\ncommitted itself here to the fight, and did so again\nrecently by supporting the strengthening of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee.\nThe tragedy of 11 September, which I refer to\nwith feeling here in New York City, was an attack on\nus all. Since then, terrorism has continued to strike: in\nEurope, in Madrid, six months ago; and in Asia, in Bali\nand Jakarta. Cowardly attacks are mounted against the\nweakest. How can we not be appalled at the tragedy of\nthe school in Beslan where children \u2014 the symbol of\ninnocence \u2014 were violently massacred?\nWe are waging a merciless fight against\nterrorism. Let us at the same time address its roots.\nThat means putting an end to situations that terrorists\nexploit; giving the world\u2019s excluded hope again;\nrestoring dignity to those peoples deprived of it; and\nensuring that dialogue and cooperation among\ncivilizations, cultures and religions prevail, rather than\nconflict and intolerance.\nGlobal threats require a strong, and always\ncollective, response. The threat of proliferation, which\n29\n\ncould merge with that of terrorism, calls for resolute\nand sustained action. The non-proliferation regime has\nbeen seriously undermined by the combined action of\ncertain States and non-State actors. That is why\nstrengthening existing instruments is today essential.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) Review Conference in 2005 will be an\nopportunity to do so.\nA safer and freer world is, first, a more just\nworld. That is why we must act relentlessly to resolve\nconflicts. I am, of course, thinking, first and foremost,\nof the Middle East, where \u2014 in the wake of the hopes\nraised by Madrid, Oslo, Camp David and Taba \u2014 the\nabsence of any prospect is today breeding despair,\nextremism and violence of every kind. This central\ncrisis can be resolved only through a negotiated\nsettlement based on international law, enabling all the\npeoples \u2014 I repeat, all the peoples \u2014 of the region to\nlive in dignity and security.\nThe road map, which the parties have accepted\nand which the Security Council has endorsed, must be\nimplemented in full and in good faith. France hopes\nthat the withdrawal from Gaza is a first step in that\ndirection. It will make every effort to get the peace\nprocess under way again. It will continue to act vis-\u00e0-\nvis all the leaders \u2014 the elected and legitimate\nleaders \u2014 of that region.\nLet us make no mistake: building peace in the\nMiddle East is a historic responsibility for our\ngeneration. Europe \u2014 the European Union \u2014 in\npartnership with the United States, Russia and the\nUnited Nations, is determined to play a political role in\norder to stimulate this process.\nIn Iraq, violence is exploding. It seems to us that\nonly when the Iraqis themselves take control of their\nfuture, and when the political process provided for by\nthe Security Council is pursued, will the country be\nable to escape the chaos that is destabilizing the entire\nregion. France, as everyone knows, did not approve of\nthe conditions in which the conflict was unleashed.\nNeither today nor tomorrow will it commit itself\nmilitarily in Iraq. However, it reaffirms its willingness,\nwith its European partners, to assist the Iraqi people in\nrebuilding their country and in restoring their\ninstitutions.\nWho can fail to see that, in the Middle East,\neverything is fragile and everything is interconnected?\nWho can fail to understand that the only path \u2014\neverywhere \u2014 is sovereignty and justice for peoples?\nOnly then will they make progress towards peace and\nthe economic and political modernization to which\nthey are entitled.\nAfrica, too, is where we will win or lose the battle\nfor justice. Without justice, there will be no peace.\nWithout peace, there will be no lasting development. The\nfuture of the African continent, and its stability and\ndevelopment, are a vital objective for us all.\nToday, with the impetus of the United Nations,\nlongstanding crises have been, or will be, settled \u2014\nMozambique, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Others,\nhowever, have broken out, and together we must\nprevent them from worsening or spreading: in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, the Central African Republic, and Darfur. The\nGreat Lakes region is slow to find the path to peace,\njust as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is\nslow to die, and the Somali question remains to be\nresolved.\nOn that great continent, which is undergoing\nprofound change, facing real threats but also\nconsiderable potential, political leaders are today\ndemonstrating a genuine determination to commit to\nworking to resolve conflicts and crises. That can be\nseen from the implementation of the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD); the resolute\ncommitment of the African Union on the political front\nand in the field; and the growing role of regional\norganizations. We resolutely support that commitment.\nFor development, but also for peace-building, we wish\nto bring about the conditions for an effective and\ncoherent partnership between North and South.\nGiven the magnitude of the goals and needs of\nthe continent, I firmly believe in the importance of\npooling the efforts of the Europeans with those of our\nAfrican partners, under United Nations auspices,\nwhenever necessary. I am convinced that our\nexperience of European integration \u2014 without\nattempting to teach any lessons \u2014 can simply be useful\nto that continent, and that is the sense of the statement\nmade on our behalf by the representative of the\npresidency of the European Union, Bernard Bot, before\nthe Assembly the day before yesterday.\nFrance has long been involved in strengthening\nAfrican peacekeeping capacities. Today, the European\nUnion intends to make a commitment immediately and\nwith determination. Operation Artemis, in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, is proof of that\n30\n\ncommitment. The creation of the European Peace\nFacility now provides major support to African\norganizations. We are willing, if the African Union so\nwishes, to assist it in its action for peace, as in the\nSudan.\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nJustice and conflict prevention cannot be\ndissociated from collective action to promote\ndevelopment. The Millennium Goals \u2014 to which the\ndeveloping countries, donor States and multilateral\ninstitutions are committed \u2014 are an overriding obligation\nfor us all, especially the wealthiest countries.\nMore than $50 billion a year is still needed to\nachieve those objectives \u2014 a fact of which we all are\naware. On Monday, 100-odd countries endorsed the\nNew York Declaration on Action Against Hunger and\nPoverty. Together they ask that additional resources be\nprovided for development, including through\ninnovative mechanisms. This is a powerful movement,\nlaunched in this very forum of the United Nations,\naimed at generating the necessary resources for justice\nand for development. It is an important milestone. My\ncountry is proud to have contributed to it, through the\nvoice of the President of the Republic, and it will\ncontinue to do so.\nBut France is also fighting for a more controlled,\nand therefore most just, globalization that would give\neveryone a chance. We advocate the establishment of a\npolitical body, in which the United Nations must have\nits due place \u2014 to improve coordination of multilateral\naction in the economic, social and environmental fields\nand to provide the necessary impetus. This is one of the\nmajor issues that we must consider in coming months,\nespecially on the basis of the proposals that the Panel\non reform is expected to make.\nAgain, a more just world is a world that respects\nhuman dignity and freedom. Fundamental human rights\nare universal. Each man, woman and child has these\ninherent rights, and it is up to us to see that they thrive\nand are respected.\nIt is also up to us to fight firmly and\nuncompromisingly against all manifestations of violence\nand discrimination based on race, origin, gender or\nreligion. Our resolve in the area of human rights, as\nelsewhere, must remain absolute and constant. I mean\nthat we need a genuine dialogue with the civil society\nand with all non-governmental organizations. The time\nhas come, it seems to us, to conclude the negotiation of\na conventional instrument on forced disappearances, to\nrecognize the rights of indigenous peoples and to\nmobilize against all forms of modern slavery.\nLet us not rule out the use of force, in certain\ncases and on the appeal of victims, to prevent massive\nhuman rights violations and acts of violence against\ncivilians. The Security Council has the honour of\nassuming this responsibility, in accordance with the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nLet us also continue putting in place mechanisms\nto combat impunity, often the prerequisite for durable\npeace and lasting reconciliation. The establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court specifically meets this\nobjective. We welcome the major milestone reached\nwith the entry into force of the Rome Statute.\nThe dignity of humankind and peoples also\nrequires due respect for cultures in their diversity. The\nsense of loss of identity contributes to the frustrations\nthat breed a good many conflicts. The unity of the\ninternational community, it goes without saying, cannot\nbe synonymous with uniformity.\nThe negotiation of a convention on cultural\ndiversity, which has just started at the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is,\ntherefore, in our view, a key objective. It must produce\na concrete result, as planned, before the 2005 general\nconference.\nOur planet is dangerous; it is also in danger. The\nearth is showing signs of strain; we are not maintaining\nit; in fact, we are plundering it; the climate is\ndeteriorating. And yet, we should remember, scarcity\nof resources has at all times been a factor in conflict.\nFor the future of our children, we must act while there\nis still time.\nIs there among us, for that matter, one single issue\nthat more obviously ignores borders than ecology and\necological security and requires coordinated action \u2014\nthat is, multilateral action? International governance in\nenvironmental matters is, it seems to us, inadequate\ntoday. We must simplify and strengthen the existing\ninternational regime on environmental issues, develop\nmonitoring, and early warning expertise, and increase\nfinancing, especially for developing countries.\nLet us be clear-sighted. For the environment, as\nfor so many other issues, prevention costs less than\n31\n\ncure. In this regard, we hope the establishment of a\nUnited Nations organization for the environment will\nbe considered, based on the achievements of the United\nNations Environment Programme. We propose that this\ngreat undertaking, which is one of the Millennium Goals,\nbe on the agenda of the September 2005 summit.\nIn a world \u2014 our world \u2014 where 800 million\npeople do not have enough to eat, where more financial\nresources are devoted to weapons than to development,\nwhere millions of men, women and children are forced\nto leave their land to escape destitution or massacres, the\ninternational community has a duty to act and to show\nimagination. It is here at the United Nations where we\ncan meet to take initiatives, to fight misfortune and to\napportion the tasks, all of them urgent.\nThe United Nations system, which is unique and\nmore indispensable than ever, also has an obligation to\nreform itself to meet new needs and new threats, and to\nmake the most of new technologies merely in order to\nlive in our times. The Secretary-General got down to\nthis problem at the start of his first mandate.\nConsiderable work has already been done. The\nproposals of the high-level panel will be the basis for\nthe next, still more ambitious, stages. France has made\nproposals on many issues, such as peacekeeping\noperations, human rights and development financing.\nWe have also indicated, with Germany, how the\nrepresentativity and legitimacy of Security Council\naction might be improved. We advocate enlargement in\nboth categories of members, permanent and non-\npermanent; and we have expressed support for the\naspirations of Germany, Japan, Brazil and India, which\nshould be accompanied by a country from Africa.\nIn a complex and unpredictable world, it is our\njoint responsibility to maintain and strengthen the one\ninstitution where all nations can work together, where\nthey can unite to shape and control their common\ndestiny. Through its legitimacy and ever-increasing\neffectiveness, the United Nations must be the\ninstrument of universal conscience for which it remains\nthe crucible.",

        "country": "USA",
        "text": "Thank you for the honour of\naddressing the General Assembly. The American\npeople respect the idealism that gave life to this\nOrganization. And we respect the men and women of\nthe United Nations, who stand for peace and human\nrights in every part of the world. Welcome to New\nYork City, and welcome to the United States of\nAmerica.\nDuring the past three years, I have addressed the\nGeneral Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country,\nand in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at\na time of tremendous opportunity for the United\nNations and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the\ncircle of liberty, security and development has been\nexpanding in our world. This progress has brought\nunity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and\nAsia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic\n8\n\nchance to widen the circle even further, to fight\nradicalism and terror with justice and dignity and to\nachieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.\nThe United Nations and my country share the\ndeepest commitments. Both the American Declaration\nof Independence and the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of\nevery human life. That dignity is honoured by the rule\nof law, limits on the power of the State, respect for\nwomen, protection of private property, free speech,\nequal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity is\ndishonoured by oppression, corruption, tyranny,\nbigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent.\nBoth our founding documents affirm that this bright\nline between justice and injustice \u2014 between right and\nwrong \u2014 is the same in every age, every culture and\nevery nation.\nWise Governments also stand for these principles\nfor very practical and realistic reasons. We know that\ndictators are quick to choose aggression, while free\nnations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know\nthat oppressive Governments support terror, while free\nGovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We\nknow that free peoples embrace progress and life,\ninstead of becoming the recruits for murderous\nideologies.\nEvery nation that wants peace will share the\nbenefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks\npeace has an obligation to help build that world.\nEventually there is no safe isolation from terror\nnetworks, or failed States that shelter them, or outlaw\nregimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually\nthere is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet\nlife by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.\nIn this young century our world needs a new\ndefinition of security. Our security is not merely found\nin spheres of influence or some balance of power. The\nsecurity of our world is found in the advancing rights\nof mankind.\nThose rights are advancing across the world. And\nacross the world, the enemies of human rights are\nresponding with violence. Terrorists and their allies\nbelieve the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nthe United States Bill of Rights and every charter of\nliberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyed\nand forgotten. They believe that dictators should\ncontrol every mind and tongue in the Middle East and\nbeyond. They believe that suicide and torture and\nmurder are fully justified to serve any goal they\ndeclare. And they act on their beliefs.\nIn the last year alone terrorists have attacked\npolice stations and banks and commuter trains and\nsynagogues and a school filled with children. This\nmonth in Beslan we saw once again how the terrorists\nmeasure their success in the death of the innocent and\nin the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was\nheld hostage along with her son and her nephew. Her\nnephew did not survive. She recently visited the\ncemetery and saw what she called the \u201clittle graves\u201d.\nShe said, \u201cI understand that there is evil in the world,\nbut what have these little creatures done?\u201d\nThe Russian children did nothing to deserve such\nawful suffering and fright and death. The people of\nMadrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have\ndone nothing to deserve sudden and random murder.\nThose acts violate the standards of justice in all\ncultures and the principles of all religions. All civilized\nnations are in this struggle together and all must fight\nthe murderers.\nWe are determined to destroy terror networks\nwherever they operate, and the United States is grateful\nto every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets,\ntrack down their operatives and disrupt their plans. We\nare determined to end the State sponsorship of terror,\nand my nation is grateful to all that participated in the\nliberation of Afghanistan. We are determined to\nprevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of the\nworld, and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many\nnations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people\nfrom an outlaw dictator.\nThe dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a\nceasefire, to fully comply with all Security Council\nresolutions, then ignored more than a decade of those\nresolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised\nserious consequences for his defiance. The\ncommitments we make must have meaning. When we\nsay \u201cserious consequences\u201d, for the sake of peace there\nmust be serious consequences. So a coalition of nations\nenforced the just demands of the world.\nDefending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough.\nOur broader mission as United Nations Members is to\napply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Our\nwider goal is to promote hope and progress as the\nalternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose\nis to build a better world beyond the war on terror.\n9\n\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have established a\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nIn three years the contributing countries have funded\nprojects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total\nof $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertaken\na $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment\nand humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing\na special focus on 15 countries where the need is most\nurgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time,\nand our unprecedented commitment will bring new\nhope to those who have walked too long in the shadow\nof death.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have joined together to\nconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We\nare supporting organizations that rescue the victims,\npassing stronger anti-trafficking laws and warning\ntravellers that they will be held to account for\nsupporting this modern form of slavery. Women and\nchildren should never be exploited for pleasure or\ngreed, anywhere on Earth.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, we should\ntake seriously the protection of life from exploitation\nunder any pretext. In this session, the General\nAssembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored by\nCosta Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human\ncloning. I support that draft resolution and urge all\nGovernments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no\nhuman life should ever be produced or destroyed for\nthe benefit of another.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have changed the way\nwe fight poverty, curb corruption and provide aid. In\n2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold\napproach that links new aid from developed nations to\nreal reform in developing ones. And through the\nMillennium Challenge Account, my nation is\nincreasing our aid to developing nations that expand\neconomic freedom and invest in the education and\nhealth of their own people.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\nStates and many other nations have acted to lift the\ncrushing burden of debt that limits the growth of\ndeveloping economies and holds millions of people in\npoverty. Since those efforts began in 1996, poor\ncountries with the heaviest debt burdens have received\nmore than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the\nbuild-up of future debt, my country and other nations\nhave agreed that international financial institutions\nshould increasingly provide new aid in the form of\ngrants rather than loans.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the world\nmust have more effective means to stabilize regions in\nturmoil and to halt religious violence and ethnic\ncleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to\nrespond to future crises.\nThe United States and Italy have proposed a\nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight\n(G-8) countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers \u2014\ninitially from Africa \u2014 so they can conduct operations\non that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the\nG-8 will help that peacekeeping force with deployment\nand logistical needs.\nAt this hour, the world is witnessing terrible\nsuffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of\nthe Sudan, crimes my Government has concluded are\ngenocide. The United States played a key role in efforts\nto broker a ceasefire, and we are providing\nhumanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people.\nRwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudan\nto help improve security so that aid can be delivered.\nThe Security Council adopted a new resolution that\nsupports an expanded African Union force to help\nprevent further bloodshed and that urges the\nGovernment of the Sudan to stop flights by military\naircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the\nCouncil on this timely and necessary action. I call on\nthe Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire it\nsigned, and to stop the killing in Darfur.\nBecause we believe in human dignity, peaceful\nnations must stand for the advance of democracy. No\nother system of government has done more to protect\nminorities, to secure the rights of labour, to raise the\nstatus of women or to channel human energy to the\npursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise of\ndemocratic Governments in predominantly Hindu and\nMuslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures.\nDemocratic institutions have taken root in modern\nsocieties and in traditional societies. When it comes to\nthe desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of\ncivilizations. People everywhere are capable of\nfreedom and worthy of freedom.\nFinding the full promise of representative\nGovernment takes time, as America has found in two\ncenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one\n10\n\nform of representative Government, because\ndemocracies by definition take on the unique character\nof the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know\nwith certainty: the desire for freedom resides in every\nhuman heart, and that desire cannot be contained\nforever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police.\nOver time and across the Earth, freedom will find a\nway.\nFreedom is finding a way in Iraq and\nAfghanistan, and we must continue to show our\ncommitment to democracies in those nations. The\nliberty that many have won at a cost must be secured.\nAs Members of the United Nations, we all have a stake\nin the success of the world\u2019s newest democracies. Not\nlong ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul\nthreatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Those\nregimes destabilized one of the world\u2019s most vital and\nmost volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples in\ndefiance of all civilized norms.\nToday, the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on the\npath to democracy and freedom. The Governments that\nare rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of\nharbouring terrorists, they are fighting terrorist groups.\nAnd this progress is good for the long-term security of\nall of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary\ncourage under difficult conditions. They are fighting to\ndefend their nation from Taliban hold-outs and helping\nto strike against the terrorist killers. They are reviving\ntheir economy. They have adopted a Constitution\nthat protects the rights of all, while honouring their\nnation\u2019s most cherished traditions. More than 10\nmillion Afghan citizens \u2014 over four million of them\nwomen \u2014 are now registered to vote in next month\u2019s\npresidential election. To any who still would question\nwhether Muslim societies can be democratic societies,\nthe Afghan people are giving their answer.\nSince the last general debate of this General\nAssembly, the people of Iraq have regained\nsovereignty. Today, in this Hall, the Prime Minister of\nIraq and his delegation represent a country that has\nrejoined the community of nations. The Government of\nPrime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every\nnation that believes in self-determination and desires\npeace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511\n(2003) and 1546 (2004), the world is providing that\nsupport. The United Nations and its Member nations\nmust respond to Prime Minister Allawi\u2019s request and\ndo more to help build an Iraq that is secure,\ndemocratic, federal and free.\nA democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies because\nterrorists know the stakes in that country. They know\nthat a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a\ndecisive blow against their ambitions for that region.\nSo a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is now\none of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq\ntoday, conducting a campaign of bombings against\ncivilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition\nforces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists\nand foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around the\nworld will never have to face them within our own\nborders.\nOur coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi\nsecurity force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nis providing vital training to that force. More than 35\nnations have contributed money and expertise to help\nrebuild Iraq\u2019s infrastructure and, as the Iraqi Interim\nGovernment moves towards national elections,\nofficials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis\nbuild the infrastructure of democracy. Those selfless\npeople are doing heroic work and are carrying on the\ngreat legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello.\nAs we have seen in other countries, one of the\nmain terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt and\ninfluence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist\nattacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach\nnational elections. The work ahead is demanding, but\nthose difficulties will not shake our conviction that the\nfuture of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty.\nThe proper response to difficulty is not to retreat \u2014 it\nis to prevail.\nThe advance of freedom always carries a cost,\npaid by the bravest among us. America mourns the\nlosses to our nation and to many others, and today I\nassure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every\nenemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of\nAfghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and\nsecurity are fulfilled.\nThese two nations will be a model for the broader\nMiddle East, a region where millions have been denied\nbasic human rights and simple justice. For too long,\nmany nations, including my own, tolerated and even\nexcused oppression in the Middle East in the name of\nstability. Oppression became common, but stability\nnever arrived. We must take a different approach. We\nmust help the reformers of the Middle East as they\nwork for freedom and strive to build a community of\npeaceful, democratic nations.\n11\n\nThat commitment to democratic reform is\nessential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace\nwill not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who\nintimidate opposition, tolerate corruption and maintain\nties to terrorist groups. The long-suffering Palestinian\npeople deserve better. They deserve true leaders\ncapable of creating and governing a free and peaceful\nPalestinian State.\nEven after the setbacks and frustrations of recent\nmonths, good will and hard effort can achieve the\npromise of the road map to peace. Those who would\nlead a new Palestinian State should adopt peaceful\nmeans to achieve the rights of their people and create\nthe reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab\nStates should end incitement in their own media, cut\noff public and private funding for terrorism, and\nestablish normal relations with Israel. Israel should\nimpose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized\noutposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian\npeople, and avoid any actions that prejudice final\nnegotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all\nfavour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails\nhis people and betrays their cause.\nThe democratic hopes we see growing in the\nMiddle East are growing everywhere. In the words of\nthe Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi:\n\u201cWe do not accept the notion that democracy is a\nWestern value. To the contrary, democracy simply\nmeans good Government rooted in responsibility,\ntransparency and accountability.\u201d\nHere at the United Nations, Members know this to be\ntrue. In recent years, this Organization has helped\ncreate a new democracy in East Timor and the United\nNations has aided other nations in making the\ntransition to self-rule.\nBecause I believe that the advance of liberty is\nthe path to both a safer and better world, today I\npropose establishing a democracy fund within the\nUnited Nations. This is a great calling for this great\nOrganization. The fund would help countries lay the\nfoundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law,\nindependent courts, a free press, political parties and\ntrade unions. Money from the fund would also help set\nup voter precincts and polling places and support the\nwork of election monitors. To show our commitment to\nthe new democracy fund, the United States will make\nan initial contribution, and I urge all other nations to\ncontribute as well.\nToday I have outlined a broad agenda to advance\nhuman dignity and enhance the security of all of us.\nThe defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the\nspread of prosperity, the advance of democracy \u2014\nthese causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the\nworld. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together\nwe can accomplish so much more.\nHistory will honour the high ideals of this\nOrganization. The Charter states them with clarity: \u201cto\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...\nto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\nlarger freedom\u201d.\nLet history also record that our generation of\nleaders followed through on these ideals, even in\nadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade,\nmembers of the United Nations did not grow weary in\nour duties, or waver in meeting them. I am confident\nthat this young century will be liberty\u2019s century. I\nbelieve we will rise to this moment, because I know the\ncharacter of so many nations and leaders represented\nhere today. And I have faith in the transforming power\nof freedom.\nMay God bless you.",

        "year": 2004,
        "country": "IRN",
        "text": "An\noverall and realistic review of the current developments\nin international relations reveals that our world today\nfaces the formidable challenge of extremism.\nExtremism has two distinct and yet\ninterconnected faces: the violence and terrorism of\nnon-State actors and the unbridled militarism of States.\nThe former leads to increasing insecurity and the latter\nto increasing lawlessness. Insecurity is manifested in\nhorrendous acts of extreme violence and terrorism,\nwhether it is in Iraq, Afghanistan or Russia.\nLawlessness is manifested in acting outside of\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter and\nrelying on the glorification of force and the blatant use\nof military might. Lawless militarism of the powerful\nhas given rise to increasing violence and terrorism and\nis also marketed as their panacea. We must be\nrelentless against the former in a truly collective and\nall-inclusive manner, and we will muster the courage\nand national discipline to guard against the latter and\nremain within the confines of international law.\nThe increasing insecurity and escalation of acts\nof violence and terrorism in different parts of the world\nare a matter of serious concern to all of us. The recent\ntragic incidents in Iraq, in the school in Beslan in the\nRussian Federation\u2019s North Ossetia, and State terrorism\nin occupied Palestine have shocked and outraged all\npeoples worldwide. No rationale can justify the killing\nof children and the innocent.\nAs terrorism has become an international\nchallenge, an effective fight against it requires a global\napproach based on collective cooperation under the\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter as well as the\nprinciples of international law. We must rise above\nbusiness-as-usual politics and avoid discrimination,\ndouble standards and selectivity in our approach to\nfighting this global menace. As a victim of terrorism,\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and we\nhave demonstrated our strong commitment to fighting\nterrorism by the arrest and handover of the greatest\nnumber of Al Qaeda members apprehended by any\nsingle State to date. Our commitment fighting terrorism\nis unwavering. However, the prevailing international\napproach, which is primarily a law and order approach,\nis clearly failing to curb terrorism. We need to revisit our\npremises and try to develop a genuinely collective,\ninclusive, well-rounded and multidisciplinary approach,\nif we are serious about this fight. No State can even\ncome close to doing it alone.\nThe increasing lawless militarism, the second\nface of the challenge we encounter, is the use of brute\nand unsanctioned military force to achieve some\npolitical goals, albeit desirable goals. A clear example\nof this lawlessness is the attack against Iraq. The attack\n33\n\nagainst Iraq was illegal. I wish to thank our\ndistinguished Secretary-General for making this\nstatement a few days ego and courageously defending\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the rule of law. If\nwe, in this body, do not collectively defend the rule of\nlaw, we have helped to send the United Nations Charter\nto oblivion, thereby serving domination and militarism.\nWe in Iran benefited greatly by the removal of\nSaddam Hussein. Many in Iran are joyous to see the\nmurderer of their sons behind bars. However, as a\nmatter of principle, and as a principle of the United\nNations Charter, this cannot be regarded as anything\nbut the fruit of the forbidden tree. The international\ncommunity has demonstrated that it will not celebrate\nachieving this desirable goal through the illegal means\nof glorifying military power and rushing to use force\nwithout the approval of the United Nations.\nThe increasing lawlessness of States constitutes\neven a greater danger to our security. It undermines our\ncollective ability to contain terrorism and violence. It\noffsets our efforts to promote justice, equality,\nfreedom, dignity and prosperity for all, because, if\ncontinued, it will lower everyone\u2019s quality of life and\ndevalue our humanity. The prevailing world realities\nillustrate that unbridled militarism and blind terrorism\nare mutually reinforcing. The international community\nmust work together to find a way to liberate itself from\nthis vicious cycle.\nIn this context, one particular area that requires\nresolute action by the international community is the\nexistence and proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. As the only victim of the unbridled use of\nthese weapons in recent years, Iran feels very strongly\nabout the absolute imperative of a collective and rule-\nbased multilateral campaign to eradicate all such\nweapons and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons as an interim measure. This must be done by\nthe universal application of disarmament and non-\nproliferation instruments in a comprehensive and non-\ndiscriminatory manner. The relevant multilateral\ninstruments must become truly universal and the rights\nand obligations of all must be scrupulously enforced.\nAccess to technology for peaceful purposes is the only\ntrue incentive for the universality of those instruments.\nAt the same time, the legitimate disarmament and non-\nproliferation concerns of the international community\nmust be addressed through transparency and the\nvigorous application of monitoring mechanisms. Iran\nhas always been prepared to contribute actively to that\nglobal effort. While we insist on our right to\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, we have left \u2014 and\nwill leave \u2014 no stone unturned in order to provide\nassurances of our peaceful intentions.\nIran has been in the forefront of efforts to\nestablish a zone free from weapons of mass destruction\nin the Middle East. This initiative, which has received\nthe repeated approval of this Assembly and the Security\nCouncil, has been systematically obstructed by Israel\u2019s\nintransigence and its rejection \u2014 regrettably, with\nimpunity \u2014 of all multilateral instruments. All countries\nof the region and beyond are unanimous in considering\nthe Israeli arsenal, including its weapons of mass\ndestruction, combined with its policy and record of\naggression and State terrorism, as the single greatest\nthreat to regional and global peace and security. Israel\ncannot hide these facts behind smoke screens. It is time\nfor the international community to show its resolve to\nmaintain the credibility of multilateral disarmament\ninstruments by taking action to compel Israel to\ncomply.\nNext year will mark the sixtieth anniversary of\nthe entry into force of the United Nations Charter. The\nnext General Assembly will receive the report of the\nHigh-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.\nNow in the final stages of preparing its report, the\nPanel would be well-advised to go beyond the\ngenerally advertised perceptions of threats and\nchallenges, and to address the more fundamental\nmalady of our age \u2014 that is, violence and the\nglorification of military might. Obviously, the\nprescription that the Panel will provide will very much\ndepend on its own perception of threats.\nIn that context, the paradigm of Dialogue among\nCivilizations, presented by President Khatami of the\nIslamic Republic of Iran and warmly received by the\ninternational community, continues to provide the only\nvehicle to help promote mutual understanding and\nfacilitate cooperation among States in the pursuit of\npeace, tolerance, freedom and prosperity.\nIn 2005, coinciding with the sixtieth anniversary\nof the adoption of the United Nations Charter, the\nimplementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue\namong Civilizations will be reviewed. Based on the\ninternational experience gained in the period from\n2001 through 2005, such a review can help the\ninternational community to further advance that\nparadigm as a long-term process towards promoting\n34\n\npeace, democracy and development \u2014 the real principles\nand objectives of the United Nations Charter.\nWe condemn all acts of violence and terrorism in\nIraq. We stress the need for promoting security and\npreserving the unity, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of Iraq, promoting democracy through\ndrafting a new constitution, holding free and fair\nelections as scheduled and accelerating the\nreconstruction of Iraq, as well as the speedy\nwithdrawal of foreign forces from that country.\nWe welcomed the formation and supported the\noperation of the Iraqi transitional government as a\npositive step towards the restoration of the Iraqi\npeople\u2019s sovereignty. We emphasize that the United\nNations has a pivotal role to play and substantial\nresponsibilities to discharge in the transitional period.\nWe also welcome the position of the United\nNations Secretary-General on the important role that\nthe neighbouring countries to Iraq can play in the\nrestoration of peace and stability in Iraq and in its\nreconstruction.\nIn the Palestinian lands, the world is witnessing,\nwith much regret and concern, the continued gross\nviolation of human rights and the Israeli policy of\noccupation and repression against the oppressed\nPalestinian people.\nA durable peace in Palestine will only be possible\nif it is based on justice and guarantees an end to the\noccupation of the Palestinian lands, restoration of the\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, return of\nthe people of the Palestinian diaspora to their\nhomeland, participation of all in a democratic process\nand the establishment of a Palestinian State with Al-\nQuds Al-Sharif as its capital.\nWe are of the view that the enlightened\nPalestinian people are capable of independently\ndeciding their political and social affairs and we\nrespect their free decisions on the future of Palestine.\nWe welcome the valuable efforts by the\nGovernment of Afghanistan to consolidate peace,\nsecurity and stability in the country. In addition,\nholding fair and free presidential and legislative\nelections and establishing a broad-based representative\nand multi-ethnic government, will be vital steps in the\nprocess of democratization and reconstruction in\nAfghanistan.\nRealization of the Millennium Development\nGoals is inseparable from viable international peace\nand security. Otherwise the political, social, economic\nand cultural problems of our world will continue to\nincrease cumulatively, leaving us in a more desperate\nsituation. In our view, the only option available to us is\nto foster closer international cooperation under\ninternationally recognized rules and instruments in the\nlight of dialogue, justice and democracy.",

        "text": "Allow me to congratulate you,\nSir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. May I assure you of\nIndia\u2019s full support in ensuring its success.\nAs we gather here in the sixtieth year since the\nUnited Nations was founded, we might perhaps pause\nto reflect on the fate of the ideas and ideals of the\ninternational community that inspired its creation. The\npost-war generation had already become aware that the\nworld which had emerged from the ashes of a global\nwar could no longer be a peaceful world unless the\nunderlying forces of conflict were addressed\neffectively by the entire community of nations as a\ncollectivity. Nations were therefore united to make the\nworld a safer and more peaceful place \u2014 a world in\nwhich free peoples could pursue together a destiny of\nshared prosperity.\nThe impulse behind the creation of global\ninstitutions nearly 60 years ago has become an even\nmore pressing reality today. If we look around us, the\nsingle most defining characteristic of our contemporary\nworld is the global, transnational character of the\nchallenges we confront, whether these are in the realm\nof international security or in that of development.\nVirtually every major issue that we face as nation-\nStates has both a domestic and a transnational\ndimension. It is becoming increasingly apparent as\nnever before that, unless we fashion a global response\nto those challenges based on a meaningful consensus,\nwe will not succeed in creating a world that truly\nmanifests the ideals of the United Nations.\nTerrorism is one such challenge for which many\nof us have paid an unacceptable price. We shall not\nforget that, three years ago, it was this great city that\nwitnessed the single most horrendous terrorist act in\nhuman history. Approximately three weeks ago, in\nRussia, the world saw another brutal act of terror\nwhich took the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians,\nincluding a large number of young children.\nTerrorism exploits the technologies spawned by\nglobalization, recruits its foot soldiers on ideologies of\nbigotry and hatred, and directly targets democracies.\nAnd yet, it is a sad reality that international networks\nof terror appear to cooperate more effectively among\nthemselves than the democratic nations that they target.\nWe speak about cooperation, but we often seem\nhesitant to commit ourselves to a truly global offensive\nto root out terrorism with the pooling of resources, the\nexchanging of information, the sharing of intelligence\nand the unambiguous unity of purpose that is required.\nThat must change. We do have a global coalition\nagainst terrorism; we must now give it substance and\ncredibility, avoiding selective approaches and political\nexpediency.\nI now turn to other challenges that we face today,\nsuch as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThere is an increasing reliance on restrictive regimes\nand on the use of punitive action to confront this threat\nto international peace and security. Although India is\nfirmly opposed to proliferation and has an impeccable\nrecord in that respect, we believe that it is only a global\nconsensus of willing nations that will ultimately prove\nto be truly effective in that regard.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention is a good\nmodel to follow with respect to other weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. It is through\nrepresentative institutions, rather than through\nexclusive clubs of privileged countries, that we can\naddress global threats posed by the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\ndelivery. As far back as 1988, Prime Minister Rajiv\nGandhi outlined a series of specific steps in an action\nplan, whose central proposition remains valid even\ntoday \u2014 that progressive steps towards the elimination\n14\n\nof weapons of mass destruction must be based on a\nbalance of obligations between those who possess such\nweapons and those who do not.\nIt is quite evident today that a global discourse is\nrequired for evolving a more cooperative and\nconsensual international security order. India believes\nthat such consensus must differentiate between States\nwhose actions strengthen non-proliferation and those\nthat weaken the realization of its objectives.\nLet me now turn to the central theme for the vast\nmajority of United Nations Members; the challenge of\ndevelopment and the eradication of mass poverty.\nGlobalization has undoubtedly brought enhanced\neffectiveness and efficiency in the functioning of our\neconomies. It has integrated marketplaces, higher\nstandards of living and a revolution in global\nconnectivity.\nBut there is also the phenomenon of widening\neconomic disparities, both within and among countries.\nConnectivity also means that the people are painfully\naware \u2014 in real time \u2014 of how far and how fast they\nare falling behind in their relative living conditions.\nDevelopment today is no longer a function of domestic\nresources and national policies alone. It is a process\nthat is vitally linked to the international economic\nenvironment that the developing countries face.\nThe international community must find ways to\ncontract those circles of exclusion. We need to find\ninnovative sources of financing and access to new\ntechnologies that are necessary to assist those who are\non the margins of globalization. Just as prosperity\ncannot be sustained by being walled in, poverty cannot\nbe banished to some invisible periphery. Development\nmust therefore return to the centre of the global\ndiscourse. We must evolve equitable and rule-based\nregimes to manage global trade, investment flows and\nthe movement of services.\nFour years ago, at our Millennium Summit, we\nadopted ambitious global development goals, but it is a\nmatter of concern that we have already fallen behind in\ntheir implementation.\nWhile globalization has generated new\nchallenges, it has also given us new technologies to\ndeal with those massive challenges. The world faces\nominous pandemics such as HIV\/AIDS, but it today\nalso possesses remedies and skills that can rid the\nworld of that scourge. We face problems of\nenvironmental degradation in many parts of our planet,\nbut we also have available safe and environment-\nfriendly technologies.\nMany countries are beset by problems of hunger\nand malnutrition, but we possess modern techniques of\nfood production and processing to make a hunger-free\nworld a credible and realistic dream. Although our\nexcessive dependence on hydrocarbons raises concerns\nabout the long-term availability of energy and about\nthe security of supplies, technology has made available\nmany environmentally sound alternative technologies.\nWhat we lack, however, is a truly global agreement and\na mobilization of the international community to\novercome the massive challenges.\nThe experience of the decades since the inception\nof the United Nations demonstrates the great\nsignificance of democracy as an instrument for\nachieving both peace and prosperity. While it is\ngratifying that the frontiers of democracy have\nexpanded dramatically in the last decade and a half,\nthey still exclude significant numbers.\nOnly a few months ago, in India\u2019s fourteenth\ngeneral election, our country went through the largest\nexercise of popular will in the world. I can therefore\nassert with confidence, the importance that national\narticulations in global forums have in truly reflecting\nthe democratically expressed will of their people. We\nchoose to overlook the absence of democracy in too\nmany cases for reasons of political expediency.\nDemocracy\u2019s representative nature validates the\ncommitments we take on as countries; it should also\ndetermine the manner in which the architecture of\ninternational institutions evolves. What is required for\nthe international community to successfully deal with\nglobal challenges \u2014 whether they be security\nchallenges, economic challenges or challenges in the\nsphere of the environment \u2014 is the existence of\ninternational institutions and a culture of genuine\nmultilateralism.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\nare the only instruments available for responding\neffectively to the challenges we face collectively. But\nwhat is missing is our sustained commitment to\ndemocratizing the functioning of the United Nations.\nIt is common knowledge that the United Nations\nis often unable to exert an effective influence on global\neconomic and political issues of critical importance.\n15\n\nThat is due to what may be called its democracy\ndeficit, which stands in the way of an effective\nmultilateralism based on a democratically-evolved\nglobal consensus.\nTherefore, reform and restructuring of the United\nNations system can alone provide a crucial link in an\nexpanding chain of efforts to refashion international\nstructures, imbuing them with a greater degree of\nparticipatory decision-making so as to make them more\nrepresentative of contemporary realities.\nOur Millennium Declaration recognized the\nurgency of the reform of the United Nations Security\nCouncil. An overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s\npopulation cannot be excluded from an institution that\ntoday legislates on an increasing number of issues,\nwith an ever-widening impact. The expansion of the\nSecurity Council, in the categories of both permanent\nand non-permanent members, and the inclusion of\ncountries like India as permanent Members would be a\nfirst step in the process of making the United Nations a\ntruly representative body.\nI would like to make brief references to two\ncountries with which India has had historically friendly\nties and whose early return to political normalcy is the\nfocus of the world\u2019s attention.\nThe situation in Iraq causes us great concern. The\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in erasing the\ndiscord of the recent past and in ensuring that the Iraqi\npeople can soon exercise effective sovereignty,\npreserving the country\u2019s unity and territorial integrity.\nAn end to the suffering of the Iraqi people and\nrecognition of their aspirations should be the guiding\nobjectives. Consistent with our longstanding ties of\nfriendship with the Iraqi people, India will contribute\nto Iraq\u2019s humanitarian and economic reconstruction.\nIn the past three years, the international\ncommunity has assisted Afghanistan in pulling back\nfrom the brink of chaos and chronic instability. We\nsincerely hope that the upcoming presidential elections\nand the subsequent parliamentary elections will allow\nthe Afghan people to express their will, free from\ninterference and intimidation. India\u2019s assistance to\nAfghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development will\ncontinue.\nRelations between India and Pakistan have been a\nmatter of attention for the international community. It\nis known that in January this year India and Pakistan\ninitiated a composite dialogue to resolve all issues,\nincluding that of Jammu and Kashmir. I reaffirm our\ndetermination to carry forward that dialogue to a\npurposeful and mutually acceptable conclusion.\nIn closing, I would like to reaffirm India\u2019s\ncommitment to the principles that have brought us\ntogether in this Organization. Those principles retain\ntheir relevance and validity even while the global\neconomy and the international political order pose new\nand very different challenges. All of us have to grow\nout of the comfort of the predictable, discard\nconstraining habits of thought, and move forward with\nconfidence to meet the demands of the present and the\nfuture. Each of us has to be prepared to take on new\nobligations and larger responsibilities relevant to the\nneeds of our time.\nI deem it a privilege to say unhesitatingly that\nIndia is conscious of the responsibilities that lie ahead.\nI speak of an India on the move \u2014 on the cutting edge\nof economic, technological and developmental\ntransformations. This is an India endowed with\noutstanding human resources, and we are putting in\nplace policies which will respond to emerging and\ncritical tasks. We have the capabilities and capacity to\ntake these on, and to participate in the restructuring of\na just and dynamic world order. We are confident that,\nin the inextricably interdependent world we live in, our\ncommitment to the common good, which this\nOrganization embodies, will be resolute and full.\nIn this, we are inspired by the vision of\ninternationalism bequeathed to us by India\u2019s first Prime\nMinister, the great Jawaharlal Nehru \u2014 a vision of a\nworld order whose pillars are peace, harmony,\ncooperation and development. That vision needs to\nreanimate the collective wisdom of the world\ncommunity for a new partnership to meet the\nunprecedented challenges we face.",

        "text": "I \nwish to begin by congratulating you, Madam President, \non your election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-first session. I am confident that, under your \nguidance, this session will achieve full success. I also \nwish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of the \nlast session, and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I \nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate \nthe Republic of Montenegro on becoming a Member of \nthe United Nations. \n The world is experiencing profound and complex \nchanges. Peace, development and cooperation have \nbecome trends of our times and represent the common \naspirations of all countries and peoples in the world. \nHowever, the world is not tranquil and the issue of \ndevelopment remains prominent. There is still a long \nway to go in the pursuit of durable peace and common \ndevelopment. Recently, the nuclear issue on the Korean \nPeninsula, the Iranian nuclear issue and the Lebanese-\nIsraeli conflict have flared up, adversely affecting \nregional and global stability and testing the wisdom, \nunity and patience of the international community. \n  \n \n06-53317 22 \n \n To maintain peace is the shared mission of the \nentire international community. Consultations based on \nequality and peaceful negotiations are the only \neffective means to resolve disputes. China, as a \npermanent member of the Security Council and a \nmember of the international community, will continue \nto make every effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of \nhotspot issues. \n As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean \nPeninsula, China is committed to maintaining peace \nand stability on the Peninsula, making it free of nuclear \nweapons and promoting the six-party talks. During the \nSecurity Council\u2019s deliberations in July regarding the \nmissile tests by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and the related resolution, China made strenuous \nefforts to engage the parties concerned, in an effort to \nmaintain peace on the Peninsula and in North-East Asia \nand preserve the unity and authority of the Security \nCouncil and safeguard the progress already made in the \nsix-party talks. \n Long-standing antagonism and mistrust between \nthe parties concerned is the main cause of the current \ndifficulty. All parties should be patient and pragmatic \nand act with vision to reduce differences and remove \nobstacles through dialogue. The six-party talks remain \nan effective mechanism to enhance understanding and \ntrust and resolve the Korean nuclear issue. We hope \nthat the parties involved will be cool-headed and more \nflexible, expand common ground, meet each other \nhalfway and work together for the early resumption of \nthe six-party talks and progressive implementation of \nthe joint statement. That is the only viable solution to \nthe Korean nuclear issue. \n With respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, China \ncalls for upholding the integrity of the international \nnuclear non-proliferation regime, and is opposed to the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It has worked for a \npeaceful resolution of the issue in order to promote \npeace and stability in the Middle East. At the same \ntime, the legitimate right of countries to the peaceful \nuse of nuclear energy should be fully respected, \nprovided they fulfil their relevant international \nobligations. \n Diplomatic negotiation represents the best chance \nto resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and serve the \ninterests of all parties. China hopes that the parties \ninvolved will exercise patience and restraint, continue \nto take a flexible approach and remain committed to \nthe right course of pursuing a peaceful resolution. \nChina will continue to play a constructive role in \nworking for an appropriate settlement of the Iranian \nnuclear issue. \n As regards the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, China \nopposes any move that will undermine peace and \nstability in the region, and calls for a comprehensive \ncessation of hostilities. China welcomes Security \nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) and hopes that it will \nbe strictly observed. China hopes that the parties \nconcerned will reach an early agreement on a \nframework of political settlement that is both just and \ndurable. \n The question of Palestine is at the core of the \nMiddle East issue. The peace process should be re-\nstarted in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations and the principle of land for peace, in \nthe interest of reaching an early and comprehensive \nsettlement of the Middle East issue, including the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, so that the countries \ninvolved can live in harmony and the region can enjoy \ndurable peace. \n The United Nations has played an instrumental \nrole in resolving regional flashpoints this year. But the \nOrganization also faces major challenges. In the new \ninternational environment, to enhance its role through \nreform is in the common interest of humankind. The \nUnited Nations needs to take resolute steps in carrying \nout reform. The United Nations should develop in a \nway that promotes the purposes and principles of its \nCharter, upholds the unity and cooperation of the \nOrganization and serves the collective interests of its \nMembers. The reform of the United Nations should be \ncomprehensive in coverage, and progress should be \nmade in security, development, human rights and other \nfields. More should be done to promote development \nand facilitate the realization of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The reform of the Organization \nshould, as far as possible, satisfy the needs of its \nMember States, particularly those from the developing \nworld. The reform should be a democratic process and \nfull consultations should be conducted to reach \nwidespread consensus. Major controversial issues \nshould be handled with caution and dealt with through \nin-depth consultations. \n China welcomes the progress made in reforming \nthe United Nations, in particular the progress in \nimplementing the World Summit Outcome. We will \n \n \n23 06-53317 \n \npledge $3 million to the United Nations Peacebuilding \nFund. We will continue to work with other countries to \nmake progress in the reform of the United Nations, \nstrengthen the unity and authority of the Organization \nand increase its efficiency and capacity to respond to \nchallenges. \n As the chief administrator of the United Nations, \nthe Secretary-General has an important role to play. In \nthe election of the next Secretary-General, China will \nfirmly support an Asian candidate. We are convinced \nthat Asia can produce a competent and well-respected \nSecretary-General acceptable to all Member States. \n The scale of assessments for the apportionment of \nthe expenses of the United Nations involves the \ninterests of all Member States and constitutes the \nfinancial foundation of the Organization. All Member \nStates have an obligation to pay their assessments on \ntime and in full. The ability to pay is the basic \nprinciple governing the scale of assessments. It should \nbe adhered to, as it has proved effective and represents \nthe general consensus of Member States. Over the \nyears, China has honoured its financial obligations in \ngood faith and has made appropriate contributions to \nthe budget of the United Nations. As China\u2019s economy \ngrows, we are prepared to increase our contributions to \nthe Organization\u2019s budget in accordance with the \nprinciple of ability to pay. We are ready to take part in \nrelevant discussions in a constructive way, and hope \nthat a fair and equitable formula will be reached on the \nbasis of extensive consultations. \n Without overall development, global peace and \nprogress cannot be sustained. In addition to developing \nthe concept of partnership and improving its \nmodalities, all countries should honour our \ncommitment to the global partnership for development \nset out in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \nConsensus, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation \nand last year\u2019s World Summit Outcome.  \n Countries should shoulder the primary \nresponsibility for their own development and \nimplement comprehensive development strategies in \nkeeping with the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). \n The international community \u2014 and developed \ncountries in particular \u2014 should increase development \nassistance, promote international trade, technology \ntransfers and investment, offer more extensive debt \nrelief, provide more support to developing countries \nand respect their ownership of national development \nstrategies. \n The United Nations should play a bigger role in \nthe field of development. It should create a fair and \nequitable framework to assess progress in meeting the \nMDGs and ensure that the United Nations Foundation \nand the various United Nations programmes and \nspecialized agencies provide greater support for \ncapacity-building programmes in developing countries. \nIt should enhance coordination between international \ndevelopment policy and monetary, financial and \ntrading regimes and create an enabling international \nenvironment for developing countries. \n The suspension of the Doha round serves \nnobody\u2019s interests. Members of the World Trade \nOrganization should demonstrate political will, \nspeedily resume the Doha development round and \nwork towards a comprehensive and balanced outcome. \n Non-governmental organizations should be \nencouraged to be more extensively and deeply involved \nin development cooperation. Their efforts and those of \nGovernments should complement each other. \n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \nechoes the calling of our times. Member States have a \ncommon responsibility to make the Council a dynamic \nand effective body. The Council should give greater \nattention to massive and gross violations of human \nrights caused by armed conflicts and should support \nthe international community in its efforts to prevent \nconflicts, restore peace and combat terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations. \n The Council should attach equal importance to \neconomic, social and cultural rights and encourage the \ninternational community and United Nations agencies \nto take effective measures to support countries in their \nefforts to realize their right to development.  \n The Council should continue to give special \nattention to the rights of women, children, persons with \ndisabilities, migrant workers, ethnic minorities and \nother vulnerable groups to ensure that they enjoy the \nsame level of respect as others. \n The Council should promote dialogue and \ncooperation on an equal footing between countries of \ndifferent social systems and levels of development, \naddress human rights issues properly and reject double \nstandards and politicization. \n  \n \n06-53317 24 \n \n For decades, relations between China and African \ncountries have been characterized by sincerity and \nmutual support. We have conducted our cooperation on \nthe basis of equality and mutual benefit, while \nsafeguarding sovereignty and independence and \npromoting social and economic development in our \nrespective countries. All that has served to bring about \nsignificant benefits for the Chinese and African peoples \nalike. \n China and Africa will hold a summit and the third \nministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa \nCooperation in Beijing from 3 to 5 November. \nFocusing on the theme of friendship, peace, \ncooperation and development, Chinese and African \nleaders will discuss ways to establish and foster a new \ntype of strategic partnership featuring political equality \nand mutual trust, win-win economic cooperation and \ncultural exchanges. They will also draft a blueprint to \nenhance China-Africa cooperation. China is committed \nto peaceful development. Africa, which is home to the \nlargest number of developing countries, is committed \nto achieving stability and renewal. Stronger ties \nbetween China and Africa will contribute to South-\nSouth cooperation and international peace and \ndevelopment. \n The conduct of China\u2019s diplomacy aims to \nsafeguard world peace and promote common \ndevelopment. China is committed to developing itself \nthrough safeguarding and promoting world peace \nthrough its own development. We are pursuing \ndevelopment that is peaceful, inclusive, cooperative \nand harmonious in nature. We will endeavour to \npromote the fundamental interests of our own people in \nharmony with the common interests of other peoples \nand to pursue peace, promote development and resolve \ndisputes through cooperation. \n China is dedicated to building a harmonious \nworld. It hopes to increase mutual respect and \nunderstanding with other countries and to live in \nharmony with them. China respects the right of a \ncountry to choose its own path to development. It \nsupports equal participation by different countries in \ninternational affairs and democracy in international \nrelations. It works to enhance mutual benefits, win-win \noutcomes and global prosperity through sharing the \nbenefits of economic globalization and technological \nprogress. China seeks to promote a diversified world \nand advance human civilization by furthering dialogue, \nunderstanding and mutual enrichment between \ndifferent cultures. China is committed to advancing \nhuman progress by enhancing dialogue, building \nmutual trust with other countries and working with \nthem to address global issues. \n China will continue to demonstrate to the world \nthat it is an important force for global peace and \ndevelopment and that the Chinese people will remain \ntrustworthy friends and cooperation partners to the \nworld\u2019s peoples.

I \nalso praise the Almighty for the increasing vigilance of \npeoples across the globe, their courageous presence in \ndifferent international settings, and the brave \nexpression of their views and aspirations regarding \nglobal issues. \n Today, humanity passionately craves commitment \nto the truth, devotion to God, the quest for justice and \nrespect for the dignity of human beings. Rejection of \ndomination and aggression, defence of the oppressed, \nand longing for peace constitute the legitimate demand \nof the peoples of the world, particularly the new \ngenerations and the spirited youth who aspire to a \nworld free from decadence, aggression and injustice, \nreplete with love and compassion. The youth have a \nright to seek justice and the truth. They have a right to \nbuild their own future on the foundations of love, \ncompassion and tranquillity. I praise the Almighty for \nthis immense blessing. \n What afflicts humanity today is certainly not \ncompatible with human dignity. The Almighty has not \ncreated human beings so that they could transgress \nagainst others and oppress them. By causing war and \nconflict, some are quickly expanding their domination, \naccumulating greater wealth and usurping all the \nresources, while others endure poverty, suffering and \nmisery as a result. \n Some seek to rule the world relying on weapons \nand threats, while others live in perpetual insecurity \nand danger. Some occupy the homeland of others, \nthousands of kilometres away from their borders, \ninterfere in their affairs and control their oil and other \nresources and strategic routes, while others are \nbombarded daily in their own homes, their children \nmurdered in the streets and alleys of their own country, \nand their homes reduced to rubble. \n Such behaviour is not worthy of human beings \nand runs counter to the truth, to justice and to human \ndignity. The fundamental question is this: under such \nconditions, where should the oppressed seek justice? \nWho, or what organization, defends the rights of the \noppressed and suppresses acts of aggression and \noppression? Where is the seat of global justice? \n A brief glance at a few examples of the most \npressing global issues further illustrates the problem. \nThe first is the unbridled expansion of nuclear, \nchemical and biological weapons. Some Powers have \nproudly announced the production of second- and \nthird-generation nuclear weapons. What do they need \nthose weapons for? Is the development and stockpiling \nof such deadly weapons designed to promote peace and \ndemocracy? Or, are the weapons actually instruments \nof coercion and threat directed against other peoples \nand Governments? \n How long should the people of the world have to \nlive with the nightmare of nuclear, biological and \nchemical weapons? What binds the Powers that \nproduce and possess those weapons? How can they be \nheld accountable by the international community? \nFurthermore, are the inhabitants of those countries \ncontent with wasting their wealth and resources on the \nproduction of such destructive arsenals? Is it not \npossible to rely on justice, ethics and wisdom instead \nof on such instruments of death? Are not wisdom and \njustice more compatible with peace and tranquillity \n \n \n37 06-52737 \n \nthan nuclear, chemical and biological weapons? If \nwisdom, ethics and justice prevail, then oppression and \naggression will be uprooted, threats will wither away \nand no reason will remain for conflict. \n This is a solid proposition, because most global \nconflicts result from injustice and from the fact that the \npowerful are not content with their own rights, but \nwant to deny the rights of others. \n People across the globe embrace justice and are \nwilling to make sacrifices for its sake. Would it not be \neasier for the global Powers to ensure their longevity \nand win hearts and minds through the championing and \nreal promotion of justice, compassion and peace, rather \nthan by continuing the proliferation of nuclear and \nchemical weapons and threatening their use? \n We have experienced the threat and the use of \nnuclear weapons. Has it achieved anything for the \nperpetrators other than the exacerbation of tension, \nhatred and animosity among nations? \n The second issue is the occupation of countries \nand the exacerbation of hostilities. The occupation of \nIraq has continued for the past three years. Not a day \ngoes by without hundreds of people being killed in \ncold blood. The occupiers are incapable of establishing \nsecurity in Iraq. Despite the establishment of a lawful \nGovernment and the National Assembly of Iraq, covert \nand overt efforts are being made to heighten insecurity, \nmagnify and aggravate differences within Iraqi society \nand instigate civil strife. \n There is no sign that the occupiers have the \nnecessary political will to eliminate the sources of \ninstability. Numerous terrorists were apprehended by \nthe Government of Iraq, only to be let loose under \nvarious pretexts by the occupiers. It seems that the \nintensification of hostilities and terrorism serves as a \npretext for the continued presence of foreign forces in \nIraq. \n Where can the people of Iraq seek refuge, and \nfrom whom should the Government of Iraq seek \njustice? Who can ensure Iraq\u2019s security? Insecurity in \nIraq affects the entire region. Can the Security Council \nplay a role in restoring peace and security in Iraq when \nthe occupiers are themselves permanent members of \nthe Council? Is the Security Council capable of making \na fair decision in this regard? \n Let us consider the situation in Palestine. The \nroots of the Palestinian problem go back to the Second \nWorld War. Under the pretext of protecting some of the \nsurvivors of that war, the land of Palestine was \noccupied through war and aggression, resulting in the \ndisplacement of millions of its inhabitants. It was \nplaced under the control of some of the survivors of the \nwar, who brought even larger population groups from \nelsewhere in the world who had not even been affected \nby the Second World War. A Government was \nestablished in the territory of others with a population \ncollected from throughout the world at the cost of \ndriving millions of the rightful inhabitants of the land \ninto diaspora and homelessness. \n That is a great tragedy with hardly any precedent \nin history. Refugees continue to live in temporary \nrefugee camps, and many have died while still hoping \none day to return to their land. Can any logic, law or \nlegal reasoning justify this tragedy? Would any \nMember of the United Nations accept such a tragedy if \nit occurred in its own homeland? \n The pretexts for the creation of the regime \noccupying Al-Quds al-Sharif are so weak that its \nsupporters want to silence any voice that tries merely \nto speak about them, as they are concerned that \nshedding light on the facts would undermine the raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre of the regime \u2014 as, indeed, it has done. The \ntragedy did not end with the establishment of a regime \non the territory of others. Regrettably, from its \ninception, that regime has been a constant source of \nthreat and insecurity in the Middle East region \u2014 \nwaging war, spilling blood and impeding the progress \nof countries in the region. It has also been used by \nsome Powers as an instrument of division, coercion \nand pressure on the people of the region. \n Reference to those historical realities may cause \nsome disquiet among supporters of that regime. But \nthese are simple facts, not myths. History has unfolded \nbefore our eyes. Worse still is the unwarranted blanket \nsupport provided to the regime. We need only watch \nwhat is happening in the Palestinian land. People are \nbeing bombarded in their own homes and their children \nmurdered in their own streets and alleys. But no \nauthority, not even the Security Council, can afford \nthem any support or protection. Why? \n Meanwhile, a Government has been formed \ndemocratically and through the free choice of the \nelectorate in a part of the Palestinian territory. But \ninstead of receiving the support of the so-called \nchampions of democracy, its ministers and members of \n  \n \n06-52737 38 \n \nparliament have been illegally abducted and \nincarcerated in full view of the international \ncommunity. \n What council or international organization is \nstanding up to protect this brutally besieged \nGovernment? Why cannot the Security Council take \nany steps? \n I should like now to address the issue of \nLebanon. For 33 long days, the Lebanese lived under a \nbarrage of fire and bombs, and close to 1.5 million of \nthem were displaced. Meanwhile, some members of the \nSecurity Council practically chose a path that provided \nample opportunity for the aggressor to achieve its \nobjectives militarily. We saw the Security Council \npractically incapacitated by certain Powers so that it \ncould not even call for a ceasefire. The Security \nCouncil sat idly by for many days, witnessing cruel \nscenes of atrocities against the Lebanese, while \ntragedies such as the one that occurred at Qana were \npersistently repeated. Why? \n In all of these cases, the answer is self-evident. \nWhen the Power behind the hostilities is itself a \npermanent member of the Security Council, how can \nthe Council fulfil its responsibilities? \n The third issue is lack of respect for the rights of \nmembers of the international community. \n I now wish to speak about some of the grievances \nof the Iranian people and about the injustices against \nthem. \n The Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is \ncommitted to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT). All our nuclear activities are \ntransparent and peaceful and are under the watchful \neyes of IAEA inspectors. Why then are there objections \nto our legally recognized rights? Which Governments \nobject to those rights? Governments that themselves \nbenefit from nuclear energy and the fuel cycle. Some \nof them have abused nuclear technology for non-\npeaceful ends, including the production of nuclear \nbombs, and some even have a bleak record of using \nthem against humanity. \n Which organization or council should address \nthose injustices? Is the Security Council in a position \nto address them? Can it stop violations of the \ninalienable rights of countries? Can it prevent certain \nPowers from impeding the scientific progress of other \ncountries? The abuse of the Security Council, as an \ninstrument of threat and coercion, is indeed a source of \ngrave concern. Some permanent members of the \nSecurity Council, even when they are themselves \nparties to international disputes, conveniently threaten \nothers with the Security Council and, even before any \ndecision by the Council, proclaim the Council\u2019s \ncondemnation of their opponents. \n The question is: what can justify such \nexploitation of the Security Council, and do not such \nacts erode its credibility and effectiveness? Can such \nbehaviour strengthen the ability of the Council to \nmaintain security? \n A review of recent historical realities would lead \nto the regrettable conclusion that justice has become a \nvictim of force and aggression. Many global \narrangements have become unjust, discriminatory and \nirresponsible as a result of undue pressure from some \nof the powerful nations. Threats to use nuclear \nweapons and other instruments of war, by some powers \nhave taken the place of respect for the rights of nations \nand the maintenance and promotion of peace and \ntranquillity. \n For some Powers, claims of promoting human \nrights and democracy can last only as long as the \nclaims can be used as instruments of pressure and \nintimidation against other nations. But when it comes \nto the interests of the claimants, concepts such as \ndemocracy, the right of self-determination of nations, \nrespect for the rights and intelligence of peoples, and \ninternational law and justice have no place or value. \nThat is blatantly manifested in the way in which the \nelected Government of the Palestinian people is \ntreated, as well as in the support extended to the \nZionist regime. It does not matter if people are \nmurdered in Palestine, turned into refugees, captured, \nimprisoned or besieged; that, apparently, does not \nviolate human rights. \n Nations are not equal in exercising their rights as \nrecognized by international law. Enjoying those rights \nis dependent on the whim of certain major Powers. \nApparently, the Security Council can only be used to \nensure the security and the rights of some big Powers. \nBut when the oppressed are being bombarded and \ndecimated, the Security Council must remain aloof and \nnot even call for a ceasefire. Is this not a tragedy of \nhistoric proportions for the Security Council, which is \ncharged with maintaining the security of countries? \n \n \n39 06-52737 \n \n The prevailing order of contemporary global \ninteractions is such that certain Powers equate \nthemselves with the international community and \nconsider that their decisions supersede those of over \n180 other countries. They consider themselves to be \nthe masters and rulers of the entire world and give \nother nations a mere second-class ranking in the world \norder. \n The question needs to be asked: if the \nGovernments of the United States or the United \nKingdom, countries which are permanent members of \nthe Security Council, commit aggression, occupation \nand violation of international law, which of the United \nNations organs can call them to account? Can a \nCouncil in which they are privileged members address \ntheir violations? Has that ever happened? In fact, we \nhave repeatedly seen the reverse. If they have a \ndifference with a nation or State, they bring the matter \nto the Security Council as claimants, then \nsimultaneously arrogate to themselves the roles of \nprosecutor, judge and executioner. Is that a just order? \nCan there be a more vivid case of discrimination and \nmore clear evidence of injustice? \n Regrettably, the persistence of some hegemonic \nPowers in imposing their exclusionist policies on the \ninternational decision-making mechanisms, including \nthe Security Council, has resulted in a growing mistrust \non the part of world public opinion that is undermining \nthe credibility and effectiveness of the most universal \nsystem of collective security. How long can such a \nsituation last in the world? It is evident that the \nbehaviour of some Powers constitutes the greatest \nchallenge before the Security Council, the entire \nOrganization and its affiliated agencies. \n The present structure and working methods of the \nSecurity Council, which are legacies of the Second \nWorld War, are not responsive to the expectations of \nthe current generation and the contemporary needs of \nhumanity. Today, it is undeniable that the Security \nCouncil, most critically and urgently, requires \nlegitimacy and effectiveness. It must be acknowledged \nthat as long as the Council is unable to act on behalf of \nthe entire international community in a transparent, just \nand democratic manner, it will be neither legitimate \nnor effective. Furthermore, the direct relationship \nbetween abuse of the veto power and erosion of the \nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Council has now \nbeen clearly and undeniably established. We cannot \nand should not expect the eradication, or even the \ncontainment, of injustice, imposition and oppression \nwithout reforming the structure and working methods \nof the Council. \n Is it appropriate to expect this generation to \nsubmit to decisions and arrangements established over \nhalf a century ago? Does not this generation or future \ngenerations have the right to make their own decisions \nabout the world in which they want to live? \n Today, genuine reform in the structure and \nworking methods of the Security Council is more \nnecessary than ever. Justice and democracy dictate that \nthe role of the General Assembly, as the highest organ \nof the United Nations, must be respected. The General \nAssembly can then, through appropriate mechanisms, \ntake on the task of reforming the Organization and, in \nparticular, rescue the Security Council from its current \nstate. In the interim, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the African \ncontinent should each have permanent-member status \nin the Security Council, with veto privilege. The \nresulting balance would hopefully prevent further \ntrampling of the rights of nations. \n It is essential that spirituality and ethics find their \nrightful place in international relations. Without ethics \nand spirituality, attained in the light of the teachings of \nthe divine prophets, justice, freedom and human rights \ncannot be guaranteed. The resolution of contemporary \nhuman crises lies in observing ethics and spirituality \nand in the governance of righteous people of high \ncompetence and piety. Should respect for the rights of \nhuman beings become the predominant objective, then \ninjustice, ill temper, aggression and war will fade \naway. \n Human beings are all God\u2019s creatures and are all \nendowed with dignity and respect. No one has \nsuperiority over others. No individual or State can \narrogate to themselves special privileges; nor can they \ndisregard the rights of others or position themselves, \nthrough influence and pressure, as the \u201cinternational \ncommunity\u201d. \n Citizens of Asia, Africa, Europe and America are \nall equal. Over six billion inhabitants of the Earth are \nall equal and worthy of respect. Justice and the \nprotection of human dignity are the two pillars in \nmaintaining sustainable peace, security and tranquillity \nin the world. \n  \n \n06-52737 40 \n \n It is for this reason that we state that sustainable \npeace and tranquillity in the world can only be attained \nthrough justice, spirituality, ethics, compassion and \nrespect for human dignity. All nations and States are \nentitled to peace, progress and security. We are all \nmembers of the international community, and we are \nall entitled to insist on the creation of a climate of \ncompassion, love and justice. \n All Members of the United Nations are affected \nby both the bitter and sweet events and developments \nin today\u2019s world. We can adopt firm and logical \ndecisions, thereby improving the prospects for a better \nlife for current and future generations. Together, we \ncan eradicate the roots of bitter maladies and \nafflictions, and instead, through the promotion of \nuniversal and lasting values, such as ethics, spirituality \nand justice, allow our nations to taste the sweetness of \na better future. \n Peoples, driven by their divine nature, \nintrinsically seek good, virtue, perfection and beauty. \nRelying on our peoples, we can take giant steps \ntowards reform and pave the road to human perfection. \nWhether we like it or not, justice, peace and virtue will \nsooner or later prevail in the world with the will of \nAlmighty God. It is imperative, and also desirable, that \nwe, too, contribute to the promotion of justice and \nvirtue. \n The Almighty and Merciful God, who is the \nCreator of the Universe, is also its Lord and Ruler. \nJustice is His command. He commands His creatures to \nsupport one another in good, virtue and piety, and not \nin decadence or corruption. He commands His \ncreatures to enjoin one another to righteousness and \nvirtue and not to sin or transgression. All divine \nprophets, from the Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) \nto the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), to the \nProphet Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), to the \nProphet Mohammad (peace be upon him), have all \ncalled humanity to monotheism, justice, brotherhood, \nlove and compassion. Is it not possible to build a better \nworld based on monotheism, justice, love and respect \nfor the rights of human beings, and thereby transform \nanimosities into friendship? \n I emphatically declare that today\u2019s world, more \nthan ever before, longs for just and righteous people \nwith love for all humanity; and above all, it longs for \nthe perfect righteous human being and the real saviour \nwho has been promised to all peoples and who will \nestablish justice, peace and brotherhood on the planet. \n O, Almighty God, all men and women are Your \ncreatures, and You have ordained their guidance and \nsalvation. Bestow upon humanity that thirsts for justice \nthe perfect human being promised to all by You, and \nmake us among his followers and among those who \nstrive for his return and his cause. ",

        "text": "Lebanon \nhas again been set ablaze by war, a further \nmanifestation of the interminable conflict in the Middle \nEast whose tragedies have, for 60 years now, \npunctuated the life of the United Nations. \n By endlessly deferring its settlement, this \nconfrontation has become the epicentre of international \ninstability, the main source of incomprehension \nbetween the different worlds and an easy alibi for all \nforms of terrorism. \n This situation is not a foregone conclusion. With \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), the United \nNations is shouldering its responsibilities. The \nunanimous adoption of this resolution has brought the \nfighting to an end. France, Europe and Asia have \ncontributed to the strengthening of United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). \n But the fire is still smouldering. It is now up to \nall the parties to work towards the consolidation of \npeace and the recovery of Lebanon. \n It is now up to Israel to complete the withdrawal \nof its forces. It is up to the Lebanese Government to \naffirm its sovereignty throughout its territory. And it is \nup to the countries in the region to cooperate fully in \norder to ensure the success of resolution 1701 (2006), \nto cooperate with the United Nations. \n In this highly sensitive region where divides \nmeet, the status quo has become unbearable. Because \nthe conflict in the Middle East is a threat to global \npeace and security, the world has no option but to be \nthe guarantor of peace. Let us tread off the beaten track \nof habit. Let us define a global strategy the key to \nwhich is an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. \n The parameters for that settlement are well-\nknown, namely, the secure coexistence of two viable \nStates, as has already been widely accepted by both \npeoples; safe and recognized borders; and a fair \nsolution for refugees and for Jerusalem. All that still \nstands between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace \nto which they aspire is the deep-seated, mutual distrust \nof two peoples shattered by history and reeling from \ntheir sufferings and ordeals. Let us now stop extremists \nfrom laying down the law! Let us help peoples and \nleaders bold enough to seek peace! Like, before them, \nSadat and Begin, Rabin and Arafat! Before this \nAssembly, I call on the world to commit itself to \nrestoring the conditions for confidence. \n The Quartet should meet shortly to start preparing \nan international conference. I propose that the \nconference define in advance the guarantees that we \nare prepared to provide to the parties as soon as they \nreach an agreement. I also propose that the conference \npave the way for a new future in the Middle East \nthrough a regional framework for collective security, \neconomic integration and dialogue among cultures. \n Building peace means fighting terrorism. It \nmeans preventing proliferation. It means shouldering \nthe \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d that we enshrined here \nlast year. \n International legality must prevail over the threats \nof proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the \ncrisis with Iran, confidence has been impaired by the \nexistence of hidden programmes. We have extended \nambitious offers of cooperation to that major country, \n \n \n21 06-52731 \n \nprovided it restores confidence by suspending its \ncontentious activities. Dialogue must prevail. Let us \ntalk in order to enter into negotiations. \n Given the seriousness of what is at stake, the \ninternational community must stand firm and united. \nWe do not aim to call regimes into question. We aim to \nensure security in accordance with international law \nand with due regard for the sovereignty of all \ncountries. \n The \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d \u2014 that was what \nwe affirmed here. In Darfur, millions of people are \nthreatened. A crime against humanity looms. \nBloodshed and turmoil are about to convulse the very \nheart of Africa again. \n France entreats the international community to \nward off a further humanitarian catastrophe. I solemnly \ncall on Sudan to accept the United Nations peace \nmission without delay. I call on the International \nCriminal Court to bring to justice those responsible for \nthese crimes. \n The time has come for the immense continent of \nAfrica, with its wealth of peoples and vibrant youth, \nwhich has embarked on the road to growth and reform, \nto find, at long last, a destiny worthy of it and of the \ncradle of humanity it represents. Humanity must be \nunited and there must be solidarity among its diverse \npeoples. Humanity needs, more than ever, a strong and \nrespected United Nations, the irreplaceable tool for \nshared sovereignty and responsibility. \n It is here that universal and sacred human rights \nmust be defended and protected. With the new Human \nRights Council and the International Criminal Court, \nthe United Nations returns to this primary vocation. Let \nus not disappoint the hopes of all those who love \nfreedom and justice. \n At a time when the world\u2019s wealth is increasing \nas never before, the separation between the rich and \npoor is becoming intolerable. From its inception, the \nUnited Nations has stood for the moral imperatives of \nfairness and solidarity. For this reason France wishes to \nsubmit to the United Nations the idea of innovative \ndevelopment financing mechanisms such as the \ninternational solidarity levy on airplane tickets, a \nmodern, pragmatic and experimental response to the \nneed to fight poverty and pandemics. In this spirit we \nwill be launching the International Drug Purchase \nFacility (UNITAID) initiative this afternoon. Let us \novercome selfishness and dogmatism and give the \ngenerous idea of a world united for human progress a \nchance. \n Finally, we all know that uncontrolled human \nactivity is bringing about a sort of slow collective \nsuicide. Disaster can only be averted if nations can \ncome together to support jointly agreed commitments. \nLet us create a United Nations for the environment, as \nthe expression of the world\u2019s ecological conscience and \nthe premier forum in which we take common action for \nfuture generations. France will host an international \nconference next year to bring together all those who \nwant to make progress on this project, which is crucial \nto the future of the planet. \n For 10 years now, a man has held high the torch \nof the United Nations and our universal values. Today, \nI wish to pay Kofi Annan the solemn and merited \nhonour of our profound admiration, of our respect and \nof our recognition. \n In a few weeks\u2019 time, we will appoint a new \nSecretary-General, who will be faced with immense \nchallenges. He will be able to count on the support of \nFrance, on its unswerving commitment to serving \npeace and justice, fraternity and progress. ",

        "text": "It honours me to deliver the statement of Saudi Arabia \non behalf of Prince Saud Al-Faisal, Foreign Minister of \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At the outset, it gives me \ngreat pleasure to express to you and your Government \nmy most sincere congratulations on your election as \nPresident of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly. I am fully confident that your diplomatic \nexpertise and thorough knowledge of international \naffairs will guarantee the success of this session. I \nwould like to express my appreciation to your \npredecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign Minister of \nSweden, who presided over the previous session with \nwisdom and expertise. The constant and diligent efforts \nof the Secretary-General were essential for revitalizing \nthe role of the United Nations and for upholding its \nprinciples, despite the difficult times and crucial \nchallenges we face. He, therefore, deserves our full \nsupport and deepest gratitude. \n The world today faces a host of global problems \nthat can be successfully addressed only within the \ncontext of multilateral cooperation under the umbrella \nof the United Nations. Human suffering caused by \npoverty, hunger, malnutrition, the spread of diseases \nand epidemics and natural disasters still require the \nconcerted efforts of the international community in \ncombating them. These global challenges do not \ndistinguish among people on the basis of colour, \nreligion or nationality. Invariably, it is the most \nvulnerable who suffer the most from these \nhumanitarian threats, making it all the more urgent for \nthe international community to assume its collective \nresponsibility in addressing these issues. \n The Middle East is in the midst of a very \ndangerous phase, with the emergence of new crises and \nthe worsening of old ones, such as the continued Israeli \noccupation of Arab lands in Palestine, Syria and \nLebanon; the volatile situation on the Lebanese-Israeli \nborder; the invasion of Lebanon; the challenges posed \nby continued instability and sectarian violence in Iraq; \nand the as-yet unresolved issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme. The accumulation of crises and tensions in \n \n \n51 06-53323 \n \nthe region can only encourage an environment in which \nextremism and terrorism will thrive with undesirable \nconsequences. It is, therefore, imperative that we warn \nspecifically against the continued trend towards \nstopgap crisis management that has taken the place of \nthe serious pursuit of a comprehensive and just \nsolution based on the principles of international law \nand resolutions of international legitimacy free from \npartiality, double standards or selectivity. \n Undoubtedly, the key to resolving these multiple \ncrises will be to invigorate the peace process with the \naim of achieving a just and durable settlement of the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, the oldest conflict in \nmodern times. This conflict is the most enduring \ninternational conflict today, and its continuation \nnegatively affects the prospects of reaching effective \nsolutions to other crises.  \n The ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine \nrepresents a flagrant breach of international law and \nthe principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of \nterritory by force and blatant disregard for resolutions \nof international legitimacy. This issue lies at the core of \nthe Middle Eastern problem. The international \ncommunity should no longer tolerate procrastination or \nrepeated failures in resolving this situation. The \ninternational community, and especially the major \nPowers, must set aside their divisions and face up to \nthe vital task of reaching, as soon as possible, a \npeaceful, just and lasting solution, in accordance with \nthe principles of international legitimacy. \n The resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \nmust be placed in its appropriate context by reconciling \nthe rights of the Palestinian and the Israeli people and \nestablishing two neighbouring States enjoying security, \nwhich is a natural outcome of peace. It is peace that \nensures security, and not the other way around. The \nbasis for a solution is clear to all of us, as expressed by \nthe President of the United States in the context of his \ntwo-State vision, which is in harmony with relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions and with the Arab Peace \nInitiative, adopted unanimously at the Beirut Summit. \nWhat is urgently needed today is to link that vision \nwith a clear agenda bound to a specific time-frame. \n Regrettably, the problem has been portrayed as \ninextricably complicated and not amenable to \ncustomary solutions. Using security considerations as a \npretext, exceptional provisions allowed one of the \nparties to the conflict to specify unilaterally the basis \nand conditions for negotiations, to choose its \nnegotiating partner, to violate previously concluded \nagreements, to impose unilateral measures and to use \nforce to impose a status quo. Our purpose here is not to \nenter into futile debates, but it is important to \nrecognize that the peace process has suffered greatly \nfrom these exceptions, which give rise to double \nstandards and inequitable obligations. \n Reviving the peace process will require serious \ninternational cooperation so as to realize the two-State \nvision within a reasonable time-frame. Recent events \nhave once again proved that military solutions only \nundermine the interests and the security of all parties. \nIt is therefore essential that we learn the lessons of our \nprevious failures in the pursuit of peace. These failures \nresulted from an exaggerated emphasis on procedural \nand provisional issues. The establishment of interim \nsecurity arrangements proved complicated and \nexhausting, while procedures for building mutual trust \nenabled the enemies of peace to undermine the peace \nprocess in its entirety.  \n What is required from us today is a fundamental \nchange in our quest to achieve a just and \ncomprehensive peace in the area. It is imperative that \nwe go to the root and heart of the conflict by \nestablishing an effective mechanism to ensure \nimmediate and peaceful negotiations addressing all \nfinal status issues, including Jerusalem, borders, \nrefugees and mutual security arrangements. The \nrequired breakthrough can be achieved only through a \nhistoric and comprehensive deal. \n A clear outline of the solution has been apparent \never since the adoption of resolution 181 (II) in 1947. \nThat resolution set out the partition of Palestine, which \nwas then under a British Mandate, into an Arab and an \nIsraeli State. It also proposed clearly defined borders \nfor those two States. Since then, the Security Council \nand the General Assembly have issued hundreds of \nresolutions, including Security Council resolution 242 \n(1967), which emphasized the principle of refraining \nfrom the acquisition of territory by force, and called on \nIsrael to withdraw from all territories occupied in \n1967. It also reiterated the need to find a just solution \nto the issue of the Palestinian refugees. Thirty-nine \nyears after the adoption of this resolution, the \nPalestinian people continue to be deprived of their \ninherent right to self-determination and of their \nentitlement to live in an independent State with Arab \nJerusalem as its capital. \n  \n \n06-53323 52 \n \n Only two months ago Israel launched a brutal act \nof aggression against Lebanon, resulting in the \ndestruction of Lebanon\u2019s infrastructure, the \ndisplacement of one third of its population, and the \nwounding and killing of thousands of civilians, \nincluding women, children and the elderly. That \nsenseless war, of course, did not make Israel any safer. \nThe only thing achieved by Israel in Lebanon was vast \ndestruction and devastation, provoking yet deeper \nhatred and enmity. We wonder how many tragedies and \nvictims we and the world will have to have before \neveryone understands that military solutions will not \nsucceed.  \n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its full \nsupport for the legitimate Lebanese Government as it \nseeks to extend its authority and influence over its \nentire territory. The Kingdom also calls on the \nbrotherly people of Lebanon to stand united so that \ntheir country may once again enjoy security and \nprosperity. We reiterate the need for all parties to \nremain committed to Security Council resolution 1701 \n(2006) and call for a rapid Israeli withdrawal from the \nSheba\u2019a Farms area, recognized by Israel as an \noccupied territory. We also call for a return to the \nArmistice Agreement signed between Lebanon and \nIsrael in 1949, as this is the only means of \nguaranteeing security and stability and avoiding a \nreturn to the status quo ante.  \n As part of our commitment to reconstruction \nefforts in Lebanon, we call on the international \ncommunity to hold Israel responsible for providing fair \ncompensation for the destruction and losses inflicted \nupon Lebanon as a result of that aggression. One of the \nreasons why Lebanon has been a victim of repeated \nIsraeli invasions \u2014 seven so far \u2014 is that we have not \nheld the aggressor accountable. \n We are profoundly concerned and extremely \nsaddened by the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, \nmarked by daily confrontation, acts of violence and \nbombings. The absence of security and stability in Iraq \ncontinues to hamper the efforts of all countries \ncommitted to assisting Iraq in overcoming its ordeal, \nrehabilitating its economy and helping it to rebuild. \nThe Kingdom has always reaffirmed the importance of \nconsolidating Iraq\u2019s unity, respecting its independence \nand sovereignty, and refraining from interfering in its \ninternal affairs. We call on the international community \nto support the programme adopted by the legitimate \nIraqi Government, led by Mr. Nuri Al-Maliki, to \nachieve a comprehensive national reconciliation; \nrevitalize Government institutions in the security, \nmilitary, political and economic areas; and disarm the \nmilitias. \n It has long been acknowledged that the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons has seriously \nundermined the security of all countries. Over time, a \nnumber of international treaties and conventions have \nproduced bilateral and multilateral obligations, but \nsuch obligations are of no use if they are not fully \nobserved and fully applied. We cannot ignore the \nserious threat to global peace and security that such \nweapons continue to pose, regardless of whether they \nare used in wars between States or fall into the hands \nof terrorist groups. \n Effectively preventing the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction will require abandoning \ndouble standards and emphasizing the importance of \nmaking the entire Middle East, including the Arab Gulf \nregion, a zone free from nuclear weapons. Israel is the \nonly country in the region that is known to possess \nweapons of mass destruction but is not subjected to any \nform of monitoring. \n While we support the right of all countries to the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy \u2014 including the \nacquisition of know-how and nuclear technology for \npeaceful purposes \u2014 we call on all parties to support \nthe path of negotiations and peaceful solutions with \nregard to the Iranian nuclear issue. Iran\u2019s repeated \nstatements that its nuclear programme is restricted to \nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy should continue to \nserve as a strong basis for negotiations.  \n The Kingdom and other members of the Gulf \nCooperation Council are eager to maintain and enhance \ntheir relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and \nwe hope that the Government of Iran will respond \npositively to the repeated calls by the United Arab \nEmirates for the peaceful resolution of the issue of the \noccupied islands belonging to the Emirates. \n International terrorism is a threat to us all. The \nongoing atrocities perpetrated by terrorists continue to \ntest our resolve to combat and counter terrorism. There \nis no acceptable justification for any form of terrorism, \nbut we cannot ignore the fact that it has roots and \ncauses that enable it to thrive. Achieving a decisive \nvictory over terrorism will require not only that we \ndeny all financial support to terrorists, but also that we \naddress the origins of extremist thought and the \n \n \n53 06-53323 \n \nconditions in which terrorists prosper. If we address the \nfeelings of despair, anger and frustration experienced \nby peoples when they are denied their legitimate rights, \nwe will deprive extremists of their causes and rallying \ncries. \n As one of the main targets of terrorism, the \nKingdom has repeatedly denounced terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations and has achieved tangible \nsuccess in combating it. The Kingdom has acceded to \nmost of the international counter-terrorism agreements, \nas well as the Arab Convention on the Suppression of \nTerrorism and the Convention of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference (OIC) on Combating \nInternational Terrorism. The Custodian of the Two \nHoly Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdelaziz Al Saud, \nhas proposed the establishment of an international \ncounter-terrorism centre under United Nations \nauspices. The only way to thwart the evil plans of \nterrorists is through the exchange of intelligence and \nupdated information among countries and agencies. \nInnovative solutions can be found to adequately \naddress reservations regarding the sensitivity of such \ninformation and its secret sources. \n As we renew our commitment to and \nparticipation in the international campaign against \nterrorism, we must at the same time draw attention to \ngrowing worldwide concerns about its flagrant use as a \npretext by extremist forces and by advocates of a clash \nbetween civilizations and cultures. \n We must periodically evaluate the effectiveness \nand success of our methods of combating terrorism and \nextremism. Here, I must reiterate that no true religion \nadvocates the use of terrorism; all of the world\u2019s great \nreligions promote noble values. We should not hold the \nvast majority of true believers responsible for the \ndeviant behaviour of a very small minority of \nadherents of any religion. Saudi Arabia strongly rejects \nthe characterization of Islam as a violent religion that \nin any way supports terrorism. Saudi Arabia calls on all \nthose who want to learn more about Islam and its \nattitude towards terrorism to consult reliable \nauthorities or documents such as the 10-year plan of \naction adopted unanimously by the members of the \nOIC at its recent extraordinary summit held in Saudi \nArabia. The success of the global counter-terrorism \ncampaign will depend on our strict adherence to the \nrules of international law, human rights, norms and \nhumanitarian values, and respect for all religions. \n The continued humanitarian suffering in Darfur is \nunacceptable to all of us. We hope that the current \nefforts to remedy the situation will be given a chance \nto succeed. We hope that this destructive conflict, \nwhich is causing unjustifiable losses on all sides, will \nswiftly come to an end. The Sudanese authorities, who \nhave achieved a historic success by bringing about \nreconciliation in the South, are cooperating with efforts \nto achieve reconciliation in Darfur, and have welcomed \nthe deployment of African Union forces. Arab States \nhave committed themselves to providing those forces \nwith the support and financial resources that they need. \nWe are concerned that the deployment of international \ntroops without the consent of the sovereign \nGovernment of the Sudan will make them part of the \nproblem, rather than part of the solution.  \n Saudi Arabia, itself a developing country, plays a \nmajor role in promoting development in other \ndeveloping and least developed countries. To help \nthose countries overcome their problems of poverty \nand underdevelopment, Saudi Arabia provides \ngenerous aid through its national institutions, as well as \nthrough international and regional institutions. Over \nthe past three decades, Saudi Arabia has contributed \napproximately 4 per cent of its gross domestic product \nin official development assistance (ODA) \u2014 the \nhighest percentage contributed by any country in the \nworld. Saudi Arabia has also offered debt relief \namounting to more than $6 billion to a number of least \ndeveloped countries. \n In order to ensure continued global economic \ngrowth, Saudi Arabia has increased its petroleum \nproduction capacity to stabilize petroleum markets, to \nensure the continued flow of sufficient petroleum and \nto curb artificially high prices. Saudi Arabia hosts the \nsecretariat of the International Energy Forum, which it \nestablished as a forum for discussing areas for \ncooperation and dialogue between petroleum-\nconsuming and petroleum-producing countries. \nIncreased cooperation between those countries will \ncontribute directly to the stabilization of petroleum \nmarkets. Petroleum, of course, is an essential strategic \ncommodity for the promotion of sustained global \neconomic growth. \n Our world is experiencing ever-accelerating and \nincreasingly complex political, economic and social \nchanges. Now more than ever, it is vital that we \ncooperate with one another to address the complex \nissues and changes facing us. Balanced and respectful \n  \n \n06-53323 54 \n \nrelations among countries, based on the principles of \njustice, mutual trust and true partnership, are essential \nto that end. Promoting healthy relations and \nunderstanding among nations will best equip us to meet \nfuture challenges and to respond to them in a way that \nwill benefit all of humanity. ",

        "text": "With \nconfidence, Iraq is making qualitative steps in the \ntransition to nationhood. Under extremely difficult \ncircumstances, Iraq is pursuing this goal and the \ninherently complicated task of rebuilding the country. \nIraq continues courageously to reach for the promise of \na democratic, federal and pluralistic State, where \ngenerations of long-oppressed Iraqis will regain their \ndignity and freedom and their right to join the civilized \nand progressive nations of the world. \n As we make our way forward, we are keen to \nestablish a deep-rooted experiment with seeds from \nIraq\u2019s authentically rich and enlightened ancient \nheritage. We will pay attention to the lessons of older \ncivilizations in Iraq and the national diversity that \nembodies the Iraqi vision. \n The new Iraq has passed through crucial \ntransitional stages in an incredibly short period of time. \n  \n \n06-53317 8 \n \nThe political process has been strengthened and \nexpanded through the participation of broader and \nmore effective social, political and civil forces. Last \nyear, the first parliamentary elections were held, \nleading to the formation of a Transitional National \nAssembly; these were followed by a national \nreferendum on a permanent constitution for the first \ntime in the history of modern Iraq. A second round of \nelections was held on 15 December 2005, which \nelected members of a Council of Representatives for a \nfour-year term. The Council convened on 1 February \n2006.  \n These developments, supported by the will of the \nIraqi political forces and with the help of our friends, \nhave galvanized the Iraqi majority with its varied \npolitical, social and intellectual background. They have \ncreated a positive political process, which has \nproduced a Government of National Unity and \nSalvation under the leadership of Prime Minister Nuri \nal-Maliki. \n The region of Iraqi Kurdistan elected a Council \nof Representatives, followed by the formation of a \nunited Kurdistan Regional Government. This \ndemonstrates that political harmony does indeed exist \nin the midst of the country\u2019s broader political process. \nIt demonstrates significant development in our \neconomy, our culture and our social fabric as a whole \nwhere security, stability and economic prosperity \nprevail. A market economy has been successful and \nprosperous for Iraq.  \n What we have achieved so far in the political \narena reflects a united national will to succeed in the \nprocess of building an Iraq that can confront all of its \nchallenges, ranging from defeating the terrorists \u2014 \nwho label others as infidels \u2014 and extremist \nideologies, to achieving security and stability.  \n Terrorist operations and activities of those who \nlabel others as infidels and organized crime groups in \nour country are not merely characterized by the killing \nof innocent people or provoking security chaos; they \nalso aim at destroying the country\u2019s infrastructure and \nhampering our ongoing efforts to rebuild the country \nand place it firmly on the path of peace, security and \ndemocracy. \n We must emphasize that the forces of extremism, \nthose that oppose democracy and human values, are \nintent on making Iraq a stepping stone for reaching \nother goals and for wreaking even more destruction. \nThese forces comprise regional and Arab elements that \nexport their crises beyond their borders in the hope that \nIraq will prove to be fertile ground on which they can \ndeal with those crises by fighting their battles on Iraqi \nsoil and among the people of Iraq. Those groups are \nmainly composed of remnants of the former dictatorial \nregime in league with organized criminal elements, \nthemselves a product of the oppression of the old \nregime and the lapses of security that followed its \ncollapse.  \n The supply line of money and weapons for those \ngroups extends to neighbouring Arab and regional \nStates. They are further supported by individuals who \ninfiltrate the borders, many of them Al-Qaida \noperatives and runaway Saddamists. Such groups \nharbour the illusion that they can suppress the will of \nour people by continuing to kill, terrorize and spread \ndespair among innocent Iraqis.  \n To confront such evil intent, national \ndetermination will flourish, welcoming all the people \nof Iraq to participate in the process of building a \nnational consensus. The Prime Minister has launched a \nnational reconciliation plan in the hope of providing \nthe protection and conditions that are necessary for \npolitical stability, calm and security. This initiative was \nformulated and developed through the contributions of \na number of political parties holding seats in \nparliament and represented on Iraq\u2019s National Security \nCouncil. That is how the first steps towards success \nwere taken. The initiative has received the support of \nseveral political opposition groups, including militant \ngroups that were previously part of the armed \nopposition. \n We continue to make efforts within the tripartite \nPresidential Council \u2014 the President, the Prime \nMinister and the Speaker of the Legislature \u2014 to \nexpand the range of participation for groups that are \ngenuinely interested in the initiative, regardless of their \nintellectual, political or organizational orientation. We \nare encouraging them to join the national effort until \nall forces are mobilized to bring about political \nstability and security in Iraq. As we are working \ntirelessly for a secure and stable Iraq, we are also \nstriving to re-establish an advanced and developed \nState where everybody can enjoy peace and security. \nWe aspire to that not only for Iraq, but also for all \nStates of the Middle East. This reflects Iraq\u2019s concern, \ndespite its preoccupation with its internal situation, \n \n \n9 06-53317 \n \nabout the suffering of its Arab brothers, especially the \nPalestinians. \n Iraq recognizes the implications of the \ndestruction suffered by the brotherly State of Lebanon \nand its proud people as a result of the Israeli military \nonslaught. Therefore, we call for implementation of the \nresolutions of international legitimacy for resolving the \nPalestinian question, which is at the core of this \nchronic conflict. We call for implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) concerning \nthe brotherly State of Lebanon, which deserves \nsympathy and genuine support through funding and \ntechnology from all civilized nations, not solely from \nits Arab brethren. \n The ongoing crises and wars in our region impose \nan enormous responsibility on the international \ncommunity and the States of the region themselves to \nreach a just and permanent political settlement that \nwould defuse crises, conflicts and wars. It also makes \nit incumbent upon us to reach a just and lasting peace \nthat rids the area \u2014 and humanity \u2014 of the scourge of \nwar, bloody conflict and terrorism. \n Iraq, through its Minister of Foreign Affairs, has \nendorsed the latest decisions of the League of Arab \nStates. Therefore, I call on the international community \nto accept these fair, logical proposals that are capable \nof ending strife and achieving security and peace for \nthe peoples of the region. \n States with influence at the international level \nhave weightier responsibilities because of the strategic \nimportance of the Middle East with respect to the \npolicies, economies and global objectives of those \ninfluential States. They should, therefore, adopt a \ndecisive approach in endorsing solutions that respect \nthe rights and interests of the States and peoples of the \nregion, as provided for in United Nations resolutions \nand human rights law. The decisive factor in \nestablishing a firm foundation for a regional \nunderstanding, leading to just solutions, to a permanent \npeace based on transparency and the principle of \nrespect for the rights of all parties and to stability in \nthe Middle East, is embodied in collaborative efforts, \nthe will of neighbouring countries and a serious resolve \nto defeat terrorism and eliminate its hotbeds and \ncauses. A global war on terrorism limited only to \nmilitary means will not be sufficient to defeat \nterrorism. We should, therefore, explore and adopt \npolitical, economic and other means and tools to \nstrengthen the elements that will lead to victory in that \nwar. In our view, it is beneficial here to consider \nGeneral Assembly resolution 60\/4, which calls on \nGovernments, the United Nations and civil society \norganizations to develop ways and means in that \ndirection and to work to promote a culture of peace and \nto condemn violence. It also calls for the formulation \nof ways and means to expand the circle of dialogue \namong civilizations in its religious, cultural and civil \nsociety dimensions. \n What I have referred to serves to strengthen \nIraq\u2019s vision of making the Middle East a zone free of \nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 especially nuclear \nweapons \u2014 similar to zones in Africa and Latin \nAmerica. Such zones safeguard the right of countries to \ndevelop technical capacity for the scientific and \npeaceful use of nuclear energy in order to achieve the \ngoals of sustainable development. In that regard, I \nwould like to emphasize that, in accordance with its \npermanent constitution and its higher national interests, \nthe new Iraq is committed not to produce such \nweapons. Iraq will also join the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and other international instruments \npertaining to such weapons. \n We would like to take this opportunity to \nemphasize that there are no weapons of mass \ndestruction of any type in the new Iraq, as has been \nconfirmed in the reports of the most recent United \nNations team to visit Iraq. Given that fact, and taking \ninto account the interests of our country, we urge the \nSecurity Council to dissolve the United Nations \nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission \n(UNMOVIC), either by decommissioning it or by \ntransforming it into an international body associated \nwith the United Nations and funded through the \nOrganization\u2019s regular budget. UNMOVIC, which in \nits current form is financed through Iraqi accounts, is a \nwaste of Iraq\u2019s resources. Our people are in desperate \nneed of those funds at this point in our country\u2019s \ndevelopment. \n Major international objectives can only be \nachieved by joining efforts and harnessing the goodwill \nof the international community in the service of all \nhumankind. The United Nations has taken it upon itself \nto play a constructive role in establishing global \nenvironment conducive to international peace and \nsecurity.  \n  \n \n06-53317 10 \n \n Changes on the international stage oblige us to \nkeep abreast of progress in every field, so as to enable \nthe United Nations to carry out its functions. That \nshould be done by better utilizing resources and \ncapabilities to benefit the peoples of the world, as well \nas by strengthening the role of the Organization in the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. There \nis also a need to respect the principle of the equality of \nall countries and their right to participate in the \nformulation and adoption of decisions and policies that \naffect the international community.  \n We also need to establish appropriate democratic \nmechanisms to make possible the participation of \ncountries with the desire and capabilities to support \nefforts and decisions conducive to the implementation \nof programmes and the achievement of our common \ngoals. In that connection, we believe that the reform of \nthe international Organization must take account of the \ninterests of all, and must seek to bring about equality \nand justice by reaching a balance through transparency \nand consensus. \n In the light of those principles, Iraq appreciates \nthe effective role played by the United Nations to \nresolve international problems. We are grateful to \nMr. Ashraf Qazi, the Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General for Iraq for the role he is playing. \nIraq hopes that the specialized agencies and \nprogrammes of the United Nations will return to Iraq to \nresume their part in its development and \nreconstruction. \n In that context, I cannot fail to refer to the \nInternational Compact with Iraq. The Compact is the \nresult of an initiative by the Government of Iraq to \nestablish an international contact group that brings \ntogether countries and organizations willing to help \nIraq and promote its reconstruction efforts. The group \nwill also help establish a sustainable partnership \nbetween Iraq and the international community to \novercome the challenges resulting from our economic \nand political transition. It is our hope that the \ninternational community will fulfil its obligations by \nproviding the resources required to address key \npriorities and achieve a common vision in the \nframework of an economic transformation process and \na sustainable development programme through agreed \nmechanisms. \n \n I express our gratitude to the ministers for foreign \naffairs who took part in the successful meeting on the \nCompact that was held in this building a few days ago. \nThe meeting proved that the new Iraq is no longer \nisolated from the international community. It also \nillustrated the fact that the new Iraq is on its way to \nassuming its proper place in a free and developed \nworld.  \n With regard to reconstruction and the \ncommitments of donor States towards Iraq, we would \nlike to thank those States that are providing assistance \nto effectively contribute to generating optimism vis-\u00e0-\nvis leaving the past behind, launching the reform \nprocess and achieving comprehensive development. \nHowever, we also look forward to further support and \ndetermination in fulfilling those commitments, because \nwe believe that launching reconstruction projects and \nstimulating the economy will be decisive in \nstrengthening the security situation and restoring \nstability to Iraq, the region and the whole world. In that \nconnection, I would like to emphasize that, with our \nfree national will, we are committed to moving forward \nin reconstructing and implementing our national \ndevelopment programmes and plans.  \n We believe that it is our right to seek the \ncancellation of the numerous and exorbitant \nreparations payments and debts of the new democratic \nIraq, which must not be made to pay for the sins of a \ndictatorship that committed many crimes against its \npeople and betrayed the nation. Iraq believes that \nachieving sustainable development goes hand in hand \nwith respecting human rights, providing security, \nachieving justice, ensuring the fair distribution of \nwealth and developing the agricultural, economic and \nservice sectors.  \n In order to rise to the challenge posed by those \ntasks, we must respect women and their rights and \nensure that they play their role in the development \nprocess and in the political arena. That goal has now \nbecome a firm principle in our pursuits, as stipulated in \nthe Iraqi constitution, which confirmed the right of \nwomen to contribute to our country by holding no less \nthan 25 per cent of the seats in the Council of \nRepresentatives. Iraqi women also now head four \nministries in the Iraq Government of National Unity. \n In conclusion, I would like to address anyone and \neveryone who harbours doubts that we are as \ncommitted and determined as we were three years ago \n \n \n11 06-53317 \n \nto achieving national reconciliation. I assure them that \nthe reconciliation process is a promising one. It is \nreceiving all possible support and is moving forward \nwith the backing of all political blocs. Our efforts will \nbe focused on making reconciliation a permanent \nliving reality that reflects the aspirations and hopes of \nthe people of Iraq. That is especially so given that \nimportant steps have been taken that have resulted in \nnational consensus and support from all the influential \npolitical forces in the country. We have also succeeded \nin charting a road map to resolve all remaining key \nissues, including those pertaining to the constitution, \nfederal regions, militias, oil, de-Baathification and the \nnew national flag, emblem and anthem. \n As we underscore our determination, we also \nexpress the hope that Arab and regional parties, \nincluding neighbouring countries in particular, will \nshare our determination and make every effort to halt \nany activities, support for or encouragement of the \nforces of terrorism \u2014 including those who label others \nas infidels and the remnants of dictatorial fascist gangs \nin the country. We also call upon neighbouring States \nto take the necessary measures to seal their borders \nagainst infiltrators. \n We reaffirm our keen desire for security and \nsafety for all our neighbours. We also express our \nadherence to the principle of non-intervention in the \ninternal affairs of other States, so as to prevent our \nterritory from being used as a staging ground to carry \nout acts against our neighbours. However, our people\u2019s \npatience is wearing thin, in particular when we see the \nblood of our innocent sons and daughters being spilled \nand defiled, our infrastructure destroyed, our mosques \nand holy shrines ruined and the rebuilding of our \narmed forces and security services impeded in an \nattempt to delay the achievement of full sovereignty. It \nis difficult for our political leadership to keep quiet \nforever.  \n The ferocity of the terrorist attacks that target our \npeople and country will not dissuade us from working \npersistently and with unwavering determination to \ndefeat the terrorists. In so doing, we shall rely on our \npeople\u2019s vigilance, our political forces and our military \nand security capabilities, which are visibly being \ndeveloped and strengthened in a number of Iraq\u2019s \ngovernorates as the tide of terrorism recedes.  \n \n The building of Iraq\u2019s national armed forces and \nits strengthening to the desired levels continues apace, \nin an effort to ensure that our capabilities reach the \nnecessary level, degree of competency and readiness to \ngradually bring about the departure of Coalition forces \nfrom our country. Those forces are present in Iraq in \naccordance with an international resolution. In the \ncurrent circumstances, their presence is essential as we \ncarry out the task of building up our armed forces that \nwill be capable of putting an end to terrorism and of \nmaintaining stability and security. Once that has been \nachieved, it will then be possible to talk about a \ntimetable for the withdrawal of multinational forces \nfrom Iraq. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n At this point, I would like once again to express \nour gratitude to the forces that participated in liberating \nour country from the worst dictatorship in history. In \nparticular, we would like to thank President George W. \nBush for his leadership in the campaign to liberate Iraq \nfrom tyranny and opening up the way for a new, \ndemocratic, pluralistic and federal Iraq that is at peace \nwith itself and the world. That historic mission has \nwell served the people of Iraq and peace and security \nin the region.  \n In conclusion, allow me, on behalf of the people \nand Government of Iraq to congratulate you, Madam \nPresident Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, on your \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. We wish you every success in \nachieving the goals set for this session, and we reaffirm \nour determination to cooperate with you fully in that \nnoble undertaking.  \n I also wish to take this opportunity to express our \ngratitude and appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for his dedicated efforts to re-energize the \nUnited Nations to work towards international peace \nand security and to promote development and respect \nfor human rights throughout the world.

        "text": "At the outset, Madam, \nlet me join previous speakers in welcoming your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. On India\u2019s behalf, I would like to \nassure you of our constructive support and \nwholehearted commitment to work with you to achieve \nboth the larger goals of the Charter and the more \nspecific goals of the reform of this Organization that \nwere set out in last year\u2019s World Summit Outcome \nDocument. \n The topic of this general debate is \u201cImplementing \na global partnership for development\u201d. It is difficult to \ncontest its relevance or topicality. Today, whether we \nlook at issues such as international trade, international \nfinancial mechanisms, methods to improve economic \nand social well-being, or even the various threats to \npeace and security that challenge our collective \nexistence, one common theme that emerges is the lack \nof an effective and equitable global partnership. This is \nan imperative even for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n The important annual report of the Secretary-\nGeneral highlights several successes in moving ahead \nwith United Nations reform. During the previous \nGeneral Assembly session, the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund, the Peacebuilding Commission and the \nHuman Rights Council were established, and the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy was \nagreed upon. We have also gradually moved forward \non management and budgetary reforms. While these \nare certainly important \u2014 indeed, critical \u2014 if we are \nhonest, we must acknowledge that significant \nunfulfilled tasks and challenges lie ahead, particularly \nwith regard to unaddressed issues, including the reform \nof the architecture of our multilateral bodies that \noversee security, trade, financial flows and \ndevelopment. Without this reform, the discontent \nassociated with globalization will only deepen. Without \nit, there cannot be substantially enhanced and assured \nresource and technology flows to developing countries, \nwhich are necessary for real economic transformation \nand for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \n It is sometimes argued that private sector \ninvestment is today replacing the traditional reliance \non aid and development assistance. While we \nappreciate the important role of private sector \ninvestment, it cannot replace public investment in \ndeveloping countries, whose absorptive capacities are \noften limited and where the physical and social \ninfrastructure is often weak. Official development \nassistance (ODA) remains an important means to \n \n \n7 06-53952 \n \naugment public investment in areas such as human \ncapital development and rural infrastructure, which \nrarely attract private sector investment. \n The process of increasing the available pool of \nresources for investment in the social and economic \ninfrastructure of developing countries can be promoted \nat one level by developed countries, expeditiously \nreaching the target of setting aside 0.7 per cent of their \ngross domestic product for official development \nassistance. \n At another level, there is also a need to develop \ninnovative sources of financing. We must evolve a \nbroader understanding of ways to encourage the least \ndeveloped countries to get out of the debt trap by \nextending debt-cancellation programmes, without \ninsisting on conditionalities, such as encouraging \nprivatization, which, applied indiscriminately, may \nrecreate the original difficulties that necessitated \nrecourse to debt in the first place. \n The impasse in international trade negotiations is \ndisappointing, to say the least, considering the hopes \nraised after the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference and \nat the Group of Eight Summit in Saint Petersburg in \nJuly. Early resumption is desirable, but adherence to \nthe existing mandate is imperative \u2014 the mandate of \nthe Doha Declaration, the July framework and the \nHong Kong Ministerial Declaration. When agriculture \nwas brought into the ambit of negotiations at the \ncreation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the \ndeveloping countries were given a clear understanding \nthat trade-distorting agricultural subsidies would be \nphased out in a time-bound manner. Minimizing the \nvulnerabilities of poor farmers must be our collective \npriority. Demanding market access from developing \ncountries, which displace low-income and subsistence \nfarmers to satisfy commercial interests, cannot be \nsupported.  \n Proportionately lower overall tariff reduction \ncommitments, operable, effective development \ninstruments for special products and a special \nsafeguard mechanism are essential if we are to ensure \nfood and livelihood security and meet the rural \ndevelopment needs of developing countries. The \noverarching principle of special and differential \ntreatment therefore remains a categorical imperative, \nand is the underlying basis of the position of \ndeveloping countries. \n In our view, there exists an overwhelming logic \nfor giving the United Nations a role in providing \ndirection to the comprehensive reform of the \ninternational financial and trading systems. These \nreforms must be aimed at building an international \narchitecture that reflects the realities of the twenty-first \ncentury and is able to create an environment that \neffectively supports national efforts to eradicate \npoverty. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nhave given hope to the poor and the underprivileged of \nthe world, and these goals are to be achieved by 2015. \nIn this context, the World Bank must remain steadfast \nin its mission to build a world free of poverty, and its \nstrategy must remain embedded in the historical \ndevelopment-centric approach.  \n The Outcome Document of last year\u2019s World \nSummit emphasized that enhancing the voice and \nparticipation of developing countries in the Bretton \nWoods institutions remains a continuous concern. The \nbridging of this voice deficit requires fundamental \nreforms in the quota structure which are long overdue \nand absolutely necessary to enhance the credibility and \nlegitimacy of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \nThe quota reforms have to begin with the revision of \nthe formula so as to reflect the relative economic \nstrengths of countries in the twenty-first century. The \nUnited Nations should encourage immediate steps \nbeing taken to initiate the second stage of IMF quota \nreform, involving a basic revision of the quota formula \nand the subsequent increase of quotas for all under-\nrepresented countries. All of this must be done in a \ntime-bound manner. \n Change is the law of life. The acute \ndissatisfaction heard in many statements is the result of \ninstitutions having been prevented from changing. \nWhat is true in the economic field is equally true of the \narchitecture of our international security system as \nreflected in this unique Organization that is supposed \nto reflect the collective will of our world, a system \nwhich remains mired in the past. Recent tragic events \nin Lebanon and the stasis in the peace process in the \nbroader Middle East have highlighted the growing \nfailure of the institution designated by the Charter as \nhaving primary responsibility for issues relating to \npeace and security. \n It is widely accepted that the Security Council \ncan no longer be regarded as reflecting the changed \ninternational environment that has emerged since the \ntime of its creation. The Security Council must not \n  \n \n06-53952 8 \n \nonly be more representative but also more effective if it \nis to be able to satisfactorily perform the role mandated \nto it by the Charter. \n At the same time, the Security Council has \nneedlessly diverted its attention to issues and areas that \ngo beyond its mandate. For instance, the inclusion of \nitems on its agenda which have nothing to do with \npeace and security represents an encroachment on the \nroles mandated to other United Nations bodies. In \norder to ensure that the international community \nexercises real ownership of the process of securing our \nworld, it is essential that comprehensive reform of the \nSecurity Council be undertaken and that its \nmembership be expanded in both the permanent and \nthe non-permanent categories. It is no accident that the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report refers to the enhancement of \nlegitimacy and the urgent need for reform to ensure the \nSecurity Council\u2019s relevance and credibility. \n The revitalization of the General Assembly is \nintertwined with the reform of the Security Council. It \nis no coincidence that its reform too has long been \nfrustrated. A strengthened and more effective United \nNations presumes a revitalized General Assembly that \nexercises its role and authority in the areas of \nresponsibility assigned to it by the Charter. These \ninclude its effectively addressing topics such as \ninternational law and human rights, financial, \nbudgetary and administrative matters, as well as the \nglobal economic architecture and important issues \nrelated to development. \n I now turn to one of the most crucial issues of our \ntimes: the problem of terrorism. While this \nphenomenon has become increasingly global, our \ncollective response to it has remained rather \ninadequate. The multiple ways in which terrorism \nchallenges the core principles of humanity and the \nmandate of the United Nations are underlined by the \noutrages perpetrated in India over the last few months. \nBarely two months ago, on a single black day, more \nthan 200 lives were lost and more than 1,000 were \ninjured by dastardly bombings in Mumbai and \nelsewhere in India. These and other such outrageous \nincidents were clearly designed to spread maximum \nterror among ordinary people. Ours is not the only \ncountry to be singled out for vicious and senseless acts \nof murder. A strong response to terrorism requires \nbroad-based international cooperation, denying to \nterrorists the space that has been available to them and \nincreasing the capability of States to address terrorist \nthreats. It requires sustained and specific cooperation \nby a variety of national, regional and global agencies. \n Earlier this month, we joined in the adoption of \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60\/288), even though, ideally, we would \nhave liked the United Nations to convey a far stronger \nmessage in order to counter terrorism. We must \ncollectively and unanimously reject the notion that any \ncause can justify terrorism. No cause can ever justify \nthe targeted killing of innocent men, women and \nchildren. The international community must signal that \nit will no longer tolerate the actions of the sponsors \nand abettors of terrorism, including States which \nwilfully fail to prevent terrorists from utilizing their \nterritory. We hope that the Strategy will provide the \nimpetus to unite the international community in its \nfight against terrorism via practical measures that \nfacilitate cooperation by way of extradition, \nprosecution, information exchange and capacity-\nbuilding. \n We went along with the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, but the comprehensive convention \non international terrorism, which remains a work in \nprogress, would have provided the requisite legal \nframework upon which a counter-terrorism strategy \ncould have been based. It cannot be beyond our \ncollective ingenuity to reach an agreement on such a \ncomprehensive convention, even though we have \nmissed the target of doing so at the sixtieth session of \nthe General Assembly. We must work together to \nfinalize and adopt the comprehensive convention, at \nleast during this session of the General Assembly. \n The existence of nuclear weapons continues to \nthreaten international peace and security. In our view, \nthe best non-proliferation measure is universal \ndisarmament, and the international community needs to \ntake immediate steps to eliminate the threat of the use \nof nuclear weapons. We have to revive momentum for \nachieving what the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi \ncalled a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world, to \nbe achieved, through negotiations, in a time-bound \nmanner. India will be presenting a working paper at \nthis session of the General Assembly on the issue of \nnuclear disarmament, on which we look forward to \nworking with Member States. \n In recent years, new dangers have emerged due to \nthe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction-related materials and technologies to non-\n \n \n9 06-53952 \n \nState actors and terrorist groups. The international \ncommunity must work together to meet those \nchallenges. India\u2019s record in that regard is impeccable, \nand we have instituted effective measures to ensure \nthat the technologies we develop are not leaked in any \nway. \n It is true that the developing countries bear the \nheaviest burden from pandemics, epidemics and \nchronic diseases. The scourge of HIV\/AIDS, malaria, \navian influenza and tuberculosis seriously threatens the \nfuture of many developing countries by robbing them \nof the most productive segment of their society \u2014 their \nyoung people \u2014 thereby affecting the future of those \ncountries. An enhanced global collaborative effort is \ncalled for to confront the proliferation of challenges \naffecting the lives of the majority of our citizens. \n We also need to address the central issue of the \nspecial needs of the developing countries, especially in \nAfrica, and of the vulnerable small States. On our part, \nwe will continue to expand our programme of South-\nSouth cooperation also through the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development, through Team 9 \u2014 our \nspecial programme for West African countries \u2014 and \nby means of the connectivity mission in Africa, as well \nas through assistance, capacity-building and \ntechnology transfer aimed at reducing the vulnerability \nof small States. \n Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who embodied \nour commitment to the United Nations ideals, said that \n \u201cin a world of incessant and feverish activity, \nmen have little time to think, much less to \nconsider ideals and objectives. Yet, how are we to \nact, even in the present, unless we know which \nway we are going and what our objectives are?\u201d  \n Confronted as we are by the globalization of \nthreats and by the limitations of our international \nsystem to address such challenges, the need for a \ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations has never \nbeen more imperative. We need to enfranchise the \nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of our time by \nreinforcing its role and authority as the core of real \nmultilateralism. \n We look forward to working closely with other \nMember States, under your leadership, Madam \nPresident, to press ahead with essential reforms at the \nUnited Nations and to implement an effective global \npartnership for development that encompasses \neveryone and enables every individual to live a life of \ndignity in a clean, safe and healthy environment.

        "text": "I am grateful for the privilege of \nspeaking to the General Assembly. \n Last week, America and the world marked the \nfifth anniversary of the attacks that filled another \nSeptember morning with death and suffering. On that \nterrible day, extremists killed nearly 3,000 innocent \npeople, including citizens of dozens of nations \nrepresented right here in this Hall. Since then, the \nenemies of humanity have continued their campaign of \nmurder. Al-Qaida and those inspired by its extremist \nideology have attacked more than two dozen nations. \nAnd recently, a different group of extremists \ndeliberately provoked a terrible conflict in Lebanon. At \nthe start of the twenty-first century, it is clear that the \nworld is engaged in a great ideological struggle \nbetween extremists who use terror as a weapon to \ncreate fear and moderate people who work for peace. \n Five years ago, I stood at this rostrum and called \non the community of nations to defend civilization and \nbuild a more hopeful future. This is still the great \nchallenge of our time. It is the calling of our \ngeneration. This morning, I want to speak about the \nmore hopeful world that is within our reach \u2014 a world \nbeyond terror, where ordinary men and women are free \nto determine their own destiny, where the voices of \nmoderation are empowered and where the extremists \nare marginalized by the peaceful majority. This world \ncan be ours if we seek it and if we work together. \n The principles of this world beyond terror can be \nfound in the very first sentence of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. This document declares \nthat the \u201cequal and inalienable rights of all members of \nthe human family [are] the foundation of freedom, \njustice and peace in the world\u201d. One of the authors of \nthis document was a Lebanese diplomat named Charles \nMalik, who would go on to become President of this \nAssembly. Mr. Malik insisted that these principles \napply equally to all people, of all religions, in all \nregions \u2014 including the men and women of the Arab \nworld that was his home. \n In the nearly six decades since that document was \napproved, we have seen the forces of freedom and \nmoderation transform entire continents. Sixty years \nafter a terrible war, Europe is now whole, free and at \npeace, and Asia has seen freedom progress and \nhundreds of millions of people lifted out of desperate \npoverty. The words of the Universal Declaration are as \ntrue today as they were when they were written. As \nliberty flourishes, nations grow in tolerance, and hope, \nand peace. And we are seeing the bright future begin to \ntake root in the broader Middle East. \n Some of the changes in the Middle East have \nbeen dramatic, and we see the results in this Hall. Five \nyears ago, Afghanistan was ruled by the brutal Taliban \nregime, and its seat in this body was contested. Now \nthis seat is held by the freely elected Government of \nAfghanistan, which is represented today by President \nKarzai. Five years ago, Iraq\u2019s seat in this body was \n \n \n9 06-52731 \n \nheld by a dictator who killed his citizens, invaded his \nneighbours and showed his contempt for the world by \ndefying more than a dozen Security Council \nresolutions. Now Iraq\u2019s seat is held by a democratic \nGovernment that embodies the aspirations of the Iraqi \npeople, represented today by President Talabani. With \nthese changes, more than 50 million people have been \ngiven a voice in this Hall for the first time in decades. \n Some of the changes in the Middle East are \nhappening gradually, but they are real. Algeria has held \nits first competitive presidential election, and the \nmilitary remained neutral. The United Arab Emirates \nrecently announced that half of its seats in the Federal \nNational Council will be chosen by elections. Kuwait \nheld elections in which women were allowed to vote \nand run for office for the first time. Citizens have voted \nin municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in \nparliamentary elections in Jordan and Bahrain and in \nmultiparty presidential elections in Yemen and in \nEgypt. These are important steps, and the Governments \nshould continue to move forward with other reforms \nthat show that they trust their people. Every nation that \ntravels the road to freedom moves at a different pace, \nand the democracies they build will reflect their own \ncultures and traditions. But the destination is the same: \na free society where people live at peace with each \nother and at peace with the world. \n Some have argued that the democratic changes \nwe are seeing in the Middle East are destabilizing the \nregion. This argument rests on a false assumption: that \nthe Middle East was stable to begin with. The reality is \nthat the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East \nwas a mirage. For decades, millions of men and women \nin the region have been trapped in oppression and \nhopelessness. And these conditions left a generation \ndisillusioned and made this region a breeding ground \nfor extremism. \n Imagine what it is like to be a young person \nliving in a country that is not moving toward reform. \nYou are 21 years old, and while your peers in other \nparts of the world are casting their ballots for the first \ntime, you are powerless to change the course of your \nGovernment. While your peers in other parts of the \nworld have received educations that prepare them for \nthe opportunities of a global economy, you have been \nfed propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame \nothers for your country\u2019s shortcomings. And \neverywhere you turn, you hear extremists who tell you \nthat you can escape your misery and regain your \ndignity through violence and terror and martyrdom. For \nmany across the broader Middle East, this is the dismal \nchoice presented every day. \n Every civilized nation, including those in the \nMuslim world, must support those in the region who \nare offering a more hopeful alternative. We know that \nwhen people have a voice in their future they are less \nlikely to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. We \nknow that when leaders are accountable to their people, \nthey are more likely to seek national greatness in the \nachievements of their citizens, rather than in terror and \nconquest. So we must stand with democratic leaders \nand moderate reformers across the broader Middle \nEast. We must give voice to the hopes of decent men \nand women who want for their children the same things \nwe want for ours. We must seek stability through a free \nand just Middle East where the extremists are \nmarginalized by millions of citizens in control of their \nown destinies. \n Today, I would like to speak directly to the \npeople across the broader Middle East. My country \ndesires peace. Extremists in your midst spread \npropaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war \nagainst Islam. This propaganda is false, and its purpose \nis to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect \nIslam, but we will protect our people from those who \npervert Islam to sow death and destruction. Our goal is \nto help you build a more tolerant and hopeful society \nthat honours people of all faiths and promotes peace. \n To the people of Iraq: nearly 12 million of you \nbraved the car bombers and assassins last December to \nvote in free elections. The world saw you hold up \npurple ink-stained fingers, and your courage filled us \nwith admiration. You have stood firm in the face of \nhorrendous acts of terror and sectarian violence, and \nwe will not abandon you in your struggle to build a \nfree nation. America and our coalition partners will \ncontinue to stand with the democratic Government you \nelected. We will continue to help you secure the \ninternational assistance and investment you need to \ncreate jobs and opportunity, working with the United \nNations and through the International Compact with \nIraq endorsed here in New York yesterday. We will \ncontinue to train those of you who stepped forward to \nfight the enemies of freedom. We will not yield the \nfuture of your country to terrorists and extremists. In \nreturn, your leaders must rise to the challenges your \ncountry is facing and make difficult choices to bring \nsecurity and prosperity. Working together, we will help \n  \n \n06-52731 10 \n \nyour democracy succeed, so that it can become a \nbeacon of hope for millions in the Muslim world. \n To the people of Afghanistan: together, we \noverthrew the Taliban regime that brought misery into \nyour lives and harboured terrorists who brought death \nto the citizens of many nations. Since then, we have \nwatched you choose your leaders in free elections and \nbuild a democratic Government. You can be proud of \nthese achievements. We respect your courage and your \ndetermination to live in peace and freedom. We will \ncontinue to stand with you to defend your democratic \ngains. \n Today, forces from more than 40 countries, \nincluding members of the NATO alliance, are bravely \nserving side by side with you against the extremists \nwho want to bring down the free Government you have \nestablished. We will help you defeat these enemies and \nbuild a free Afghanistan that will never again oppress \nyou or be a safe haven for terrorists. \n To the people of Lebanon: last year, you inspired \nthe world when you came out into the streets to \ndemand your independence from Syrian dominance. \nYou drove Syrian forces from your country and you \nre-established democracy. Since then, you have been \ntested by the fighting that began with Hizbollah\u2019s \nunprovoked attacks on Israel. Many of you have seen \nyour homes and your communities caught in crossfire. \nWe see your suffering, and the world is helping you to \nrebuild your country and helping you deal with the \narmed extremists who are undermining your \ndemocracy by acting as a State within a State. \n The United Nations has passed a good resolution \nthat has authorized an international force, led by \nFrance and Italy, to help you restore Lebanese \nsovereignty over Lebanese soil. For many years, \nLebanon was a model of democracy and pluralism and \nopenness in the region \u2014 and it will be again. \n To the people of Iran: the United States respects \nyou. We respect your country. We admire your rich \nhistory, your vibrant culture and your many \ncontributions to civilization. You deserve an \nopportunity to determine your own future, an economy \nthat rewards your intelligence and your talents and a \nsociety that allows you to fulfil your tremendous \npotential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that \nyour rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use \nyour nation\u2019s resources to fund terrorism, and fuel \nextremism, and pursue nuclear weapons. \n The United Nations has passed a clear resolution \nrequiring that the regime in Tehran meet its \ninternational obligations. Iran must abandon its nuclear \nweapons ambitions. Despite what the regime tells you, \nwe have no objection to Iran\u2019s pursuit of a truly \npeaceful nuclear power programme. We are working \ntoward a diplomatic solution to this crisis, and as we \ndo, we look to the day when you can live in freedom \nand America and Iran can be good friends and close \npartners in the cause of peace. \n To the people of Syria: your land is home to a \ngreat people with a proud tradition of learning and \ncommerce. Today your rulers have allowed your \ncountry to become a crossroad for terrorism. In your \nmidst, Hamas and Hizbollah are working to destabilize \nthe region, and your Government is turning your \ncountry into a tool of Iran. This is increasing your \ncountry\u2019s isolation from the world. Your Government \nmust choose a better way forward by ending its support \nfor terror, and living in peace with your neighbours, \nand opening the way to a better life for you and your \nfamilies. \n To the people of Darfur: you have suffered \nunspeakable violence, and my nation has called these \natrocities what they are: genocide. For the last two \nyears, America joined with the international \ncommunity to provide emergency food aid and support \nfor an African Union peacekeeping force. Yet your \nsuffering continues. The world must step forward to \nprovide additional humanitarian aid, and we must \nstrengthen the African Union force that has done good \nwork but is not strong enough to protect you. The \nSecurity Council has approved a resolution that would \ntransform the African Union force into a blue-helmeted \nforce that is larger and more robust. To increase its \nstrength and effectiveness, NATO nations should \nprovide logistics and other support. The regime in \nKhartoum is stopping the deployment of this force. If \nthe Sudanese Government does not approve this \npeacekeeping force quickly, the United Nations must \nact. Your lives and the credibility of the United Nations \nare at stake. So today I am announcing that I am \nnaming a presidential Special Envoy \u2014 former \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development, Andrew Natsios \u2014 to lead \nAmerica\u2019s efforts to resolve the outstanding disputes \nand help bring peace to your land. \n The world must also stand up for peace in the \nHoly Land. I am committed to two democratic States, \n \n \n11 06-52731 \n \nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \nsecurity. I am committed to a Palestinian State that has \nterritorial integrity and will live peacefully with the \nJewish State of Israel. This is the vision set forth in the \nroad map, and helping the parties to reach this goal is \none of the great objectives of my presidency. The \nPalestinian people have suffered from decades of \ncorruption and violence and the daily humiliation of \noccupation. Israeli citizens have endured brutal acts of \nterrorism and constant fear of attack since the birth of \ntheir nation. Many brave men and women have made \nthe commitment to peace. Yet extremists in the region \nare stirring up hatred and trying to prevent these \nmoderate voices from prevailing. \n This struggle is unfolding in the Palestinian \nterritories. Earlier this year, the Palestinian people \nvoted in a free election. The leaders of Hamas \ncampaigned on a platform of ending corruption and \nimproving the lives of the Palestinian people, and they \nprevailed. The world is waiting to see whether the \nHamas Government will follow through on its \npromises or pursue an extremist agenda. The world has \nsent a clear message to the leaders of Hamas: serve the \ninterests of the Palestinian people, abandon terror, \nrecognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, honour agreements and \nwork for peace. \n President Abbas is committed to peace and to his \npeople\u2019s aspirations for a State of their own. Prime \nMinister Olmert is committed to peace, and has said he \nintends to meet with President Abbas to make real \nprogress on the outstanding issues between them. I \nbelieve that peace can be achieved and that a \ndemocratic Palestinian State is possible. I hear from \nleaders in the region who want to help. I have directed \nSecretary of State Rice to lead a diplomatic effort to \nengage moderate leaders across the region to help the \nPalestinians reform their security services and support \nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders in their efforts to come \ntogether to resolve their differences. \n Prime Minister Blair has indicated that his \ncountry will work with partners in Europe to help \nstrengthen the governing institutions of the Palestinian \nadministration. We welcome his initiative. Countries \nlike Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have made clear \nthat they are willing to contribute the diplomatic and \nfinancial assistance necessary to help these efforts \nsucceed. I am optimistic that, by supporting the forces \nof democracy and moderation, we can help Israelis and \nPalestinians build a more hopeful future and achieve \nthe peace in the Holy Land that we all want. \n Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed; it \nmust be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are \nmaking the choice for freedom. And the nations \ngathered in this Hall must make a choice as well. Will \nwe support the moderates and reformers who are \nworking for change across the Middle East, or will we \nyield the future to the terrorists and extremists? \nAmerica has made its choice: we will stand with the \nmoderates and reformers. \n Recently, a courageous group of Arab and \nMuslim intellectuals wrote me a letter. In it, they said \nthis: \u201cThe shore of reform is the only one on which any \nlights appear, even though the journey demands \ncourage, patience and perseverance\u201d. The United \nNations was created to make that journey possible. \nTogether we must support the dreams of good and \ndecent people who are working to transform a troubled \nregion. And by doing so, we will advance the high \nideals on which this institution was founded. ",

        "text": "I  wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. I am convinced that under your able \nleadership, the current session will be a fruitful one. I \nalso wish to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for \nher contribution during her presidency of the previous \nsession. \n The current international environment is highly \ncomplex. Mankind is facing both unprecedented \nopportunities and challenges. There is a growing trend \ntowards peace, development and cooperation in the \nworld. But, on the other hand, traditional and non-\ntraditional security threats are intertwined; hotspot \nissues are acute; the gap between the North and South \nis widening; trade protectionism is resurfacing; and \ndeveloping countries generally remain in a \ndisadvantaged position. The steady trend towards \neconomic globalization and towards a multi-polar \nworld is fostering a new way of thinking about \ninternational relations. \n In this Hall two years ago, Chinese President Hu \nJintao called on mankind to build a harmonious world \nwith lasting peace and common prosperity in the \ntwenty-first century (see A\/60\/PV.5). The core message \nof his call is that, while recognizing the diversity of the \nworld, differences of interests and diversity of cultures, \nwe should harmonize interests, defuse conflicts and \npromote cooperation for win-win progress in a \npeaceful and cooperative manner. \n In its 62-year history, the United Nations has \nplayed an irreplaceable role in promoting humankind\u2019s \ncause of peace and development. The current session of \nthe General Assembly should focus on promoting \nharmonious coexistence among countries. Resolving \nhotspot issues and peacefully settling international \ndisputes through dialogue and cooperation are not only \nexplicitly called for by the United Nations Charter. \nThey are also the right way to uphold world peace and \nstability and achieve mutual benefit and a win-win \nsituation for all. \n China remains committed to seeking a peaceful \nsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula \nthrough dialogue to uphold peace and stability on the \npeninsula and throughout North-East Asia. The Six-\nParty Talks have become an important platform for the \nparties concerned to maintain dialogue and \nconsultations on achieving denuclearization on the \npeninsula, normalizing relations between the countries \nconcerned and building a new harmonious architecture \nin North-East Asia. We will continue to play a \nconstructive role in advancing the process of the Six-\nParty Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean \npeninsula. \n Diplomatic negotiations are the best option for \nresolving the Iranian nuclear issue peacefully and \nmeeting the common interests of the international \ncommunity. China opposes nuclear-weapon \nproliferation and stands for upholding the international \nnuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and \nstability in the Middle East. No non-proliferation effort \nshould deviate from the goal of upholding international \npeace and stability. Countries should honour their due \ninternational obligations, and their right to peaceful use \nof nuclear energy should be fully respected. China \nurges the parties concerned to show flexibility and \nresume negotiations at an early date. China will \ncontinue to contribute its share to the peaceful \nsettlement of the Iranian nuclear issue. \n The Palestine-Israel conflict is at the core of the \nMiddle East issue. China supports the just cause of the \nPalestinian and other Arab peoples and the restoration \nof their lawful national rights, and it sincerely hopes \nthat Arab countries and Israel will promptly end their \ndisputes through political negotiations on the basis of \nrelevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of \nland for peace. China calls on Palestine to strengthen \nits unity and welcomes the initiative to hold an \ninternational conference on the Middle East. We hope \nthat the Iraqi people will continue to work for national \nreconciliation and restore peace and stability at an \nearly date, and that this will lead to a comprehensive, \njust and lasting resolution of the Middle East issue. \n The trilateral dialogue and consultation among \nthe United Nations, the African Union and the \nSudanese Government on an equal footing is an \neffective mechanism for resolving the Darfur issue. \nThe international community should work to sustain \nthe current sound momentum and give full play to the \nrole of the trilateral mechanism as the main channel. \nWe should adhere to dual-track strategy, promote \nbalanced progress in peacekeeping operations and the \npolitical process and seek a lasting solution to the \nDarfur issue through making progress in the security, \npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social areas. \nChina is committed to a proper settlement of the Darfur \nissue. It has provided humanitarian assistance to Darfur \non a number of occasions and will send a military \nengineering unit to join the peacekeeping operations \nthere. China will continue to firmly support the peace \nand national reconciliation process in the Sudan and \nwill contribute to the resolution of the Darfur issue and \npeace, stability and development in the Sudan. \n At its current session, the General Assembly \nshould promote the peaceful development of all \ncountries. Poverty is a major source of disputes, and \nonly development can eliminate poverty. Human \ndevelopment concerns us all. Obviously, it is \nimpossible to build common prosperity when there is a \nhuge chasm between the North and the South. The \ninternational community should act with a sense of \nurgency and redouble its efforts to deliver the \nMillennium Development Goals, narrow the North-\nSouth gap and, in particular, meet Africa\u2019s special \ndevelopment needs. Developed countries should \nincrease assistance, further open their domestic \nmarkets, transfer more technologies to developing \ncountries and provide greater debt relief to them. \n For their part, developing countries, on their part, \nshould adopt development strategies and policies \nsuited to their national conditions and boost their \neconomic development. We should support an open, \nequitable and fair multilateral trade regime and oppose \ntrade protectionism. We should work for an early, \ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \nRound negotiations and make it a development round. \nReform of the international economic system should \nfully reflect changes in the world economy and should \ngive developing countries more say and greater \nrepresentation in the international economic system. \n China gives a high priority to strengthening \ninternational cooperation on development as it \ndevelops itself. We seek coordinated and balanced \nglobal development. While a developing country itself, \nChina has all along provided assistance to African \ncountries and other developing countries, according to \nits ability, and has helped them to improve their \ncapacity for independent and sustainable development. \nThat is because we believe that lasting peace and the \ncommon prosperity of the world is possible only with \nthe development of developing countries. \n To help Africa attain stability, security and \nsustainable development is the common responsibility \nof the international community. China and African \ncountries enjoy mutual political respect and equality \nand economic mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. \nThey support one another and maintain close \nconsultation in international affairs. We draw on one \nanother\u2019s strengths in governance to promote \ndevelopment. Thanks to our joint efforts, China-Africa \ncooperation has yielded fruitful results. Such \ncooperation is well received by the African countries, \nand it has brought great benefits to both the Chinese \nand African peoples. China\u2019s cooperation with Africa \nfacilitates Africa\u2019s cooperation with other countries and \nis not targeted against any third party. \n The current session of the General Assembly \nshould be devoted to promoting harmony between man \nand nature. Development in the world has both \nadvanced material progress and caused ecological \nimbalance and environmental pollution. To protect our \ncommon homeland is a matter of vital importance for \nour common future. \n Climate change is an environmental issue, but \nultimately it is an issue of development. It has arisen in \nthe course of development and can be resolved only \nthrough development. We should uphold the \nframework of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \nand adhere to the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. Developed countries \nshould face up to their responsibilities, fulfil their \ncommitments on emissions reduction in earnest and \ncontinue to take the lead in emissions reduction after \n2012. We should strengthen international cooperation \non energy, resources and the environment, step up \nefforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving \ntechnologies, environmental protection technologies \nand low-carbon energy technologies, and establish \nreasonable mechanisms for financing and technology \ntransfer. That will enable developing countries to gain \naccess to and afford advanced environmental-\nprotection technologies, enhance capacity to respond to \nclimate change and effectively address climate change \nthrough achieving sustainable development. \n China takes climate change seriously. Though its \ncurrent per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less \nthan one third of the average of developed countries, \nChina, acting in a way that is highly responsible to \nmankind, has taken many effective measures to tackle \nclimate change, including adopting a series of laws and \nregulations and setting the goals of reducing energy \nintensity and increasing forest cover. The Chinese \nGovernment has set the following targets: to reduce \nenergy intensity and total discharge of major pollutants \nby about 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively and \nto increase the forest cover rate to 20 per cent for the \nperiod between the end of 2005 and 2010. Under its \nNational Climate Change Programme, China will take \nan active part in international cooperation in climate \nchange and contribute its share to protecting the global \nclimate. \n Advancing United Nations reform and enabling \nthe Organization to play a more important role in \nmaintaining world peace, promoting common \ndevelopment and strengthening cooperation among \ncountries is crucial to building a harmonious world. \nChina supports the reform of the United Nations. The \nreform decisions made at the high-level meeting \nmarking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations \nheld in 2005 should be implemented in a \ncomprehensive and balanced manner. Priority should \nbe given to reform in the area of development, and the \nUnited Nations should increase its input in that area. \nThe Human Rights Council should build on the \noutcome of reform in its previous phase and become a \nplatform for dialogue and cooperation rather than an \narena for political confrontation. Security Council \nreform should give priority to increasing the \nrepresentation of developing countries and give small \nand medium-sized countries more opportunities to \nparticipate in decision-making. Reform proposals \nshould be based on the widest possible consensus. \nChina is ready to work with all other parties to turn \nreform into a process of strengthening consultation and \ndialogue and promoting solidarity and cooperation \namong all United Nations Member States. \n China is committed to building a society of \ndemocracy, the rule of law, equity and justice, integrity \nand amity, vitality, stability and order, where people \nlive in harmony with nature. To achieve that goal, \nChina is fully implementing the outcomes of scientific \nthinking on development. We are working to boost \nsocial productivity and ensure people\u2019s rights in the \npolitical, economic, cultural, social and other fields. By \nstriving to build a harmonious society and by \nimproving the material and cultural life of one fifth of \nthe world\u2019s population, China is making a true \ncontribution to the building of a harmonious world. \n China has always pursued its own development as \na part of the global effort to promote the common \nprogress of mankind. In international affairs, we are \ncommitted to the following goals: promoting \nparticipation in international affairs by all countries on \nan equal footing and democracy in international \nrelations; enabling all countries to share the benefits of \neconomic globalization and progress in science and \ntechnology for a win-win outcome; promoting \nexchanges and understanding among civilizations and \ndiversity in the world; enhancing dialogue and trust \namong countries; and jointly tackling global issues. \nChina unswervingly pursues a path of peaceful \ndevelopment and will continue to make further \ncontributions to humankind\u2019s cause of peace and \ndevelopment. \n Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. \nWe will not permit any challenge to the one-China \nprinciple and General Assembly resolution 2758 \n(XXVI). For 15 years running, since 1993, the General \nAssembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related \nissues in the agenda of the General Assembly session. \nThis fully demonstrates that any move that runs \ncounter to the purposes and principles of the United \nNations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General \nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any \nsupport from the United Nations Member States and is \ndoomed to failure. We hope that the countries \nconcerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated \nby the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong \nmoves of this kind. \nThe Taiwan authorities are now obstinately \nclinging to the separatist course of \u201cTaiwan \nindependence\u201d and are trying by all means to secure a \nreferendum on applying for membership of the United \nNations under the name Taiwan. This is another \ndangerous step towards \u201cde jure Taiwan independence\u201d \ntaken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked, \nthis move will gravely endanger peace and stability \nacross the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region. \nThe Chinese Government has always made every effort \nto promote with all sincerity peaceful development of \ncross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful \nreunification. However, we will never allow anyone to \nseparate Taiwan from China in name or in any other \nway. We hope that the international community will \ncontinue to support China\u2019s cause of peaceful \nreunification, support the Chinese people in opposing \nand repulsing separatist activities for \u201cTaiwan \nindependence\u201d and work with us to maintain peace and \nstability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-\nPacific region. \n The Olympic Games, which represent humanity\u2019s \naspiration for peace, development, cooperation and \nfriendship, will for the first time be held in China, a \ncountry both ancient and youthful, starting on 8 August \n2008. One World, One Dream   this is the theme of \nthe Beijing Olympic Games. The 1.3 billion people in \nChina, together with the rest of the world, are eagerly \nlooking forward to the opening of the Games. The \n2008 Olympic Games are a great event for both the \nChinese people and the other peoples of the world. We \nare confident that with the efforts made by the Chinese \npeople and with strong support from the international \ncommunity, the 2008 Olympic Games will stand out as \na highly successful event. \n",

        "text": "Thank you for the opportunity \nto address the General Assembly of the United Nations.  \n Sixty years ago, representatives from 16 nations \ngathered to begin deliberations on a new international \nbill of rights. The document they produced is called the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and it stands \nas a landmark achievement in the history of human \nliberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the \ninherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of \nall members of the human family as the foundation of \nfreedom and justice and peace in the world. As we \ngather for the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide \nour work in this world.  \n Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires \nconfronting long-term threats. It also requires \nanswering the immediate needs of today. \n We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet, \nthere are some areas where we can all agree. When \ninnocent people are trapped in a life of murder and \nfear, the Declaration is not being upheld. When \nmillions of children starve to death or perish from a \nmosquito bite, we are not doing our duty in the world. \nWhen whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of \nthe global economy, we are all worse off. Changing \nthese underlying conditions is what the Declaration \ncalls the work of larger freedom, and it must be the \nwork of every nation in this Assembly. \n This great institution must work for great \npurposes, to free people from tyranny and violence, \nhunger and disease, illiteracy and ignorance and \npoverty and despair. Every member of the United \nNations must join in this mission of liberation. The \nfirst mission of the United Nations requires liberating \npeople from tyranny and violence. The first article of \nthe Universal Declaration begins by stating that all \nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and \nrights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists \nwho kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their \nhateful vision on humanity. The followers of this \nviolent ideology are a threat to civilized people \neverywhere. All civilized nations must work together \nto stop them by sharing intelligence about their \nnetworks and choking off their finances and bringing to \njustice their operatives. In the long run, the best way to \ndefeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a \nmore hopeful vision   the vision of liberty that \nfounded this body. \n The United States salutes the nations that have \nrecently taken strides towards liberty, including \nUkraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Liberia, \nSierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories \nhave moderate leaders   mainstream leaders   who \nare working to build free institutions that fight terror, \nenforce the law and respond to the needs of their \npeople. The international community must support \nthese leaders so that we can advance the vision of two \ndemocratic States   Israel and Palestine   living side \nby side in peace and security. \n Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and \nIraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet, the \nextremists have responded by targeting them for \nmurder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of \nfear; and the extremists are doing everything within \ntheir power to bring down these young democracies. \nThe people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have \nasked for our help, and every civilized nation has a \nresponsibility to stand with them. Every civilized \nnation also has a responsibility to stand up for the \npeople suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North \nKorea, Syria and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people \nthe fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal \nDeclaration. \n Americans are outraged by the situation in \nBurma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year \nreign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and \nworship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are \npersecuted. Forced child labour, human trafficking and \nrape are common. The regime is holding more than \n1,000 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, \nwhose party was elected overwhelmingly by the \nBurmese people in 1990. \n The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the \npeople\u2019s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This \nmorning, I am announcing a series of steps to help \nbring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will \ntighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the \nregime and their financial backers. We will impose an \nexpanded visa ban on those responsible for the most \negregious violations of human rights   as well as their \nfamily members. We will continue to support the \nefforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate \nsuffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and \nall nations to use their diplomatic and economic \nleverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their \nfreedom. \n In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is \nnearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their \nfreedom. And as that nation enters a period of \ntransition, the United Nations must insist on free \nspeech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and \ncompetitive elections. \n In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a \ntyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down \non peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to \nflee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe \nregime is an assault on its people and an affront to the \nprinciples of the Universal Declaration. The United \nNations must insist on change in Harare and must insist \non freedom for the people of Zimbabwe. \n In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering \nrepression; and in the Darfur region, many are losing \ntheir lives to genocide. America has responded with \ntough sanctions against those responsible for the \nviolence. We have provided more than $2 billion in \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to \nattending a Security Council meeting that will focus on \nDarfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate \nFrance\u2019s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan\u2019s \nneighbours. The United Nations must answer this \nchallenge to conscience and live up to its promise to \npromptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur. \n Secondly, the mission of the United Nations \nrequires liberating people from hunger and disease. \nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration states that \neveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate \nfor the health and well-being of himself and of his \nfamily, including food, clothing, housing, and medical \ncare. Around the world, the United Nations is carrying \nout noble efforts to live up to these words. \n Feeding the hungry has long been a special \ncalling for my nation. Today, more than half the \nworld\u2019s food assistance comes from America. We send \nemergency food stocks to starving people, from camps \nin Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed \nan innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which \nAmerica would purchase the crops of local farmers in \nAfrica and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food \nfrom the developed world. This would help build up \nlocal agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the \ndeveloping world, and I urge our United States \nCongress to support this initiative. \n Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of \ngenerosity to fighting HIV\/AIDS and malaria. Five \nyears ago, in sub-Saharan Africa, an AIDS diagnosis \nwas widely considered a death sentence, and fewer \nthan 50,000 people infected with the virus were \nreceiving treatment. The world responded by creating \nthe Global Fund, which is working with Governments \nand the private sector to fight the disease around the \nworld. The United States decided to take these efforts a \nstep further by launching the $15 billion Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has \nhelped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a \nmillion people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. \nSo earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial \ncommitment   to $30 billion. By coming together, the \nworld can turn the tide against HIV\/AIDS, once and for \nall. \n Malaria is another common killer. In some \ncountries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV\/AIDS, \nthe vast majority of them children under the age of \nfive. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary, because \nthe disease is preventable and treatable. The world \nknows what it takes to stop malaria   bed nets, indoor \nspraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years \nago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. \nOther nations and the private sector are making vital \ncontributions as well. I call on every Member State to \nmaintain its focus, to find new ways to join this cause \nand to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by \nmalaria are no more. \n Thirdly, the mission of the United Nations \nrequires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy \nand ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration \nstates that everyone has the right to education. When \nnations make the investments needed to educate their \npeople, the whole world benefits. Better education \nunleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds \nto the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes \nbetter health and greater independence. Better \neducation increases the strength of democracy and \nweakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United \nStates is joining with nations around the world to help \nthem provide a better education for their people. \n A good education starts with good teachers. In \npartnership with other nations, America has helped \ntrain more than 600,000 teachers and administrators. A \ngood education requires good textbooks. So, in \npartnership with other nations, America has distributed \ntens of millions of textbooks. A good education \nrequires access to good schools. So, in partnership with \nother nations, America is helping nations raise \nstandards in their schools at home and providing \nscholarships to help students come to schools in the \nUnited States. And in all our education efforts, our \nnation is working to expand access for women and \ngirls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is \nopen to all. \n Finally, the mission of the United Nations \nrequires liberating people from poverty and despair. \nArticle 23 of the Universal Declaration states that \neveryone has the right to work, to free choice of \nemployment and to just and favourable conditions of \nwork. In the twenty-first century, this requires ensuring \nthat people in poor countries have the same \nopportunity to benefit from the global economy that \ncitizens of wealthy countries have. \n The United Nations provides vital economic \nassistance designed to help developing nations grow \ntheir economies and reach their potential. The United \nStates agrees with that position. We have dramatically \nincreased our own development assistance, and we are \ndelivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the \nMillennium Challenge Account to reward nations that \ngovern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people \nand promote economic freedom. With this aid, we are \nreaching out to developing nations in partnership, not \npaternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars \nreach those who need them and achieve results. \n In the long run, the best way to lift people out of \npoverty is through trade and investment. A nation that \nis open and trading with the world will create \neconomic rewards that far exceed anything it could get \nthrough foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing \nnations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per \ncapita income grow about three times faster than other \ndeveloping countries. Open markets ignite growth, \nencourage investment, increase transparency, \nstrengthen the rule of law and help countries help \nthemselves. \n The international community now has a historic \nchance to open markets around the world by \nconcluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A \nsuccessful Doha outcome would mean real and \nsubstantial openings in agriculture, goods and services, \nand real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting \nsubsidies. The world\u2019s largest trading nations, \nincluding major developing countries, have a special \nresponsibility to make the tough political decisions to \nreduce trade barriers. America has the wi11 and \nflexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our \nnegotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I \nurge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the \nsame. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good \nDoha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation \nopportunity. \n In the meantime, America wi11 continue to \npursue agreements that open trade and investment \nwherever we can. We recently signed free-trade \nagreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South \nKorea. These agreements embody the values of open \nmarkets, transparent and fair regulation, respect for \nprivate property and resolving disputes under rules of \ninternational law. These are good agreements. They are \nnow ready for a congressional vote, and I urge our \nCongress to approve them as soon as possible. \n As America works with the United Nations to \nalleviate immediate needs, we are also coming together \nto address longer-term challenges. Together, we are \npreparing for pandemics that could cause death and \nsuffering on a global scale. Together, we are working \nto stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Together, we are confronting the \nchallenges of energy security, environmental quality \nand climate change. I appreciate the discussions on \nclimate change led by the Secretary-General last night. \nI look forward to further discussions at the meeting of \nmajor economies in Washington later this week. \n The goals I have outlined today cannot be \nachieved overnight, and they cannot be achieved \nwithout reform of this vital institution. The United \nStates is committed to a strong and vibrant United \nNations. Yet the American people are disappointed by \nthe failures of the Human Rights Council. That body \nhas been silent on repression by regimes from Havana \nand Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing \nits criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on \nhuman rights in the world, the United Nations must \nfirst reform its own Human Rights Council. \n Some have also called for reform of the structure \nof the Security Council, including an expansion of its \nmembership. The United States is open to this \nprospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for \npermanent membership on the Security Council and \nthat other nations should be considered as well. The \nUnited States will listen to all good ideas, and we will \nsupport changes to the Security Council as part of \nbroader United Nations reform. And in all we do, I call \non Member States to work for an institution that \nadheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the \nhigh principles of the Universal Declaration. \n With the commitment and courage of those in this \nHall, we can build a world where people are free to \nspeak, assemble and worship as they wish   a world \nwhere children in every nation grow up healthy, get a \ndecent education and look to the future with hope   a \nworld where opportunity crosses every border. America \nwill lead towards that vision, in which all are created \nequal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the \nfounding conviction of my country. It is the promise \nthat established this body. And, with our determination, \nit can be the future of our world.  \n",

        "text": " To all the  peoples represented here, I convey the brotherly \ngreetings of France. Mr. Secretary-General, you have \nan enormous responsibility, and you have the trust of \nFrance. \n This is the first time that I address this Assembly \non behalf of France. It is a solemn and moving moment \nfor me. I cannot help thinking of all of those men and \nwomen who, at one of the most tragic moments in the \nhistory of humanity, as the world stood on the brink of \nbarbarity, finding that prospect intolerable, succeeded \nin countering force and violence and barbarity with \njustice and peace. Thus was the United Nations born. \n The United Nations is not a mere political \nconstruct. It is not a mere legal construct. It is an \nawakening of the human conscience against everything \nthat threatens to destroy humanity. \n I have never believed that the United Nations \ncould one day root out the violence that lies within \nhuman beings. But what I do know deep down inside \nme, what we all know deep down, is that in spite of all \nits failures, without the United Nations it would have \nbeen impossible to put an end to conflicts that seemed \nto be insoluble. Remember the genocide of the \nCambodian people, remember the suffering inflicted \nupon them; remember the independence of Namibia; \nremember the independence of Timor. Look at the \nGreat Lakes region, or West Africa. Without the United \nNations, the world might have experienced a third \nworld war, doubtless even more terrible than the two \nprevious ones. \n France is convinced that the United Nations is the \nonly remedy we have for the blindness and folly that \nsometimes take hold of human beings. \n The message I wish to bring to you in the name \nof France is a simple one: in this world where the fate \nof each of us depends on the fate of others, the United \nNations should not be weakened; the United Nations \nmust be strengthened. Reforming the United Nations so \nas to adapt it to the realities of our world is an absolute \npriority for France. We cannot afford to wait any \nlonger. The world\u2019s problems must be addressed and \nresolved globally. No one on this Earth can alone \nprotect themselves from the consequences of climate \nwarming, the clash of civilizations, major epidemics. \nAgainst selfishness, against fanaticism, against hatred, \nit is our duty to renew that appeal to the universal \nconscience by virtue of which, for the first time in the \nhistory of all the peoples of the world, all nations \nagreed to meet within a common forum in order to set \naside what divides us and talk to one another. \nThis appeal to the universal conscience is an \nappeal for peace. It is an appeal for open-mindedness. \nIt is an appeal for diversity. And it is an appeal for \njustice. France has always sought greatness for the sake \nof men and women, not for its own sake. Like all \nnations, France, in the course of its long history, has \nmade mistakes, and has sometimes been at fault. But \nits people, the people of France, have always chosen to \nbe on the side of freedom and democracy. France is \nloyal to its friends and to the values it shares with \nthem. But this loyalty is not submission. This loyalty is \nnot a shackle. And France intends to draw on that \nloyalty in the cause of openness to others, of openness \nto the world. I want the world to know that France is \nwilling to talk to everybody in the world, in every \ncontinent. \n But I would also like to say that openness is not \nrenunciation. Understanding is not weakness. \nWeakness and renunciation are not factors of peace; \nthey are factors of war. France and Europe in the past \nexperienced the tragic consequences of such an attitude \nfor themselves and for the whole world. When you are \nweak and submissive, you get ready to accept war. We \nall have a duty to ensure that that never happens again. \nThere will be no peace in the world if the international \ncommunity compromises with the right of peoples to \nself-determination and if it compromises with human \nrights. \n There will be no peace in the world unless the \ninternational community is unshakeable in its \ndetermination to fight terrorism. There will be no peace \nin the world unless the international community stands \nunited in its resolve to put an end to the wars in the \nMiddle East, to put an end to the horror in Darfur, to \nthe tragedy of Lebanon or to the humanitarian disaster \nin Somalia. And I weigh my words carefully. There \nwill be no peace in the world if the international \ncommunity falters in the face of the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons. \n Iran is entitled to nuclear power for civilian \npurposes. But if we allow Iran to acquire nuclear \nweapons, there would be an unacceptable risk to \nstability in the region and in the world. I want to say \nhere, in the name of France, that we can only resolve \nthis crisis by combining firmness with dialogue. It is in \nthat spirit that France will act. \n I want to say here, in the name of France, that it \nis the duty of the international community to confront \nthose who seek power and constantly threaten the \nfragile balance of peace and to do so by bringing to \nbear its unwavering unity and its determination to \nuphold the law. I want to say, in the name of France, \nthat there will be no peace in the world without respect \nfor diversity, without respect for national identities, \nwithout respect, I venture to say, for religions and \nbeliefs, or without respect for cultures. Attachment to \none\u2019s faith, to one\u2019s identity, to one\u2019s language and \nculture, and to one\u2019s way of life, thought and belief   \nall that is legitimate, and profoundly human. To deny \nthat is to sow the seeds of humiliation. It would stoke \nthe fires of nationalism, fanaticism and terrorism. We \nwill not avert the clash of civilizations by forcing \neveryone to think and to believe the same things. \nFrance intends to pursue, together with all people of \ngoodwill, this battle to build a new world order of the \ntwenty-first century. \n We want a Lebanon living independently, and we \nsay that France will always stand shoulder to shoulder \nwith Lebanon in its desire for independence. Tomorrow \nwe hope that Israelis and Palestinians will find within \nthemselves the strength to live in peace. Peace is \npossible. It is possible now. And we will devote all of \nour energies to that. \n We want to see the peaceful coexistence of the \nmain religions to vanquish fundamentalism and \nfanaticism. But I want to say, with all due gravity, that \nthere is too much injustice in the world for the world to \nhope to live in peace. \n The founding fathers of the United Nations knew \nthat the world\u2019s future could be read in the eyes of a \ntortured child; a hungry child; children who watch their \nparents being humiliated; children who since birth have \nknown nothing but war; children torn from their \nhomes, their lands, their families. Because in those \nchildren\u2019s desperate eyes there is not only suffering, \nbut also all the wars and revolts that will drench the \nworld in blood tomorrow. \n Let us look at the world as it is. Let us look at \nwhat we have made of it. Have we wanted enough to \nmake it more just? The answer is no. Have we done \nenough to achieve that end? The answer is no.  \n When the Berlin wall fell, we all dreamed that \nhistory would cease to be tragic. Let us look at our \nworld as it is so that we can make it better. Let us \njudge our world by the yardstick of justice. Justice \nmeans that the Palestinian people can regain a country \nand build a State. Justice means that the Israeli people \ncan enjoy the right to live in security. Justice means \nthat the Lebanese people can regain their freedom. \nJustice means that the Iraqi people, in all their \ndiversity, can find within themselves the path to \nreconciliation and democracy. Justice means that a \ndeveloping country on which we wish to impose \nenvironmental rules, even though its inhabitants have \nbarely enough to eat, can be helped to put such rules in \nplace. Justice means that we cannot tap a country\u2019s \nresources without paying a fair price for them. \n Let us look squarely at our world. Never before \nhas there been so much easy money, with so much \nwealth concentrated in the hands of a few large groups. \nThroughout the world, even in the richest countries, \nthere are many men and women who no longer have \neven a hope of emerging some day from their material \nand moral distress.  \n In conclusion, I appeal to the conscience of all \nthose who have a responsibility for the conduct of \nworld affairs. Because if we do nothing, the poor and \nthe exploited will one day rise up against the injustice \ndone to them. \n What the world needs is a new mindset: a \ngenuine New Deal on a global scale, an ecological and \neconomic New Deal. On behalf of France, I call on all \nStates to join together to found the new world order of \nthe twenty-first century, predicated on the key idea that \nthe common goods of humanity must be the \nresponsibility of all of humanity.  \n On behalf of France, I solemnly appeal to the \nUnited Nations to provide itself, in this era marked by \nthe return of scarcity, with the means to guarantee that \nall people throughout the world have access to vital \nresources: water, energy, food, medicine and \nknowledge. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to \nconcern itself with the issue of fairer distribution of \nwealth and of the income derived from commodities \nand technology. I solemnly appeal to the United \nNations to concern itself with the moralization of \nfinancial capitalism. I solemnly appeal to the United \nNations to go further in combating corruption, which \nsaps countries that are suffering and all too poor. \n Things must change. Mindsets must change. \nBehaviour must change. This is our responsibility now, \nbecause tomorrow it will be too late. If we fail to act, \nwe will see a resurgence of all the threats that the \npeople of the post-war world believed they had \novercome. Let us not take this risk lightly.  \n Peoples of the world, we can, together, build a \nbetter future for all people. It is up to us alone; it is up \nto our capacity to remain faithful to the values that \nhave brought us together here today. You have \nunderstood. France believes that we have no more time \nto wait. France calls for action. France urges action. \nFrance is committed to action in the service of world \npeace. \n",

        "text": "I am pleased and  grateful to the Almighty to have the opportunity once \nagain to attend this important universal forum. \n In the present tumultuous world, loud outcries, \nthreats and tensions predominate. The big Powers are \nunable to solve present problems, and mistrust in \nregional and international arenas is on the rise. The \npsychological security of societies is targeted by an \nonslaught of political and propaganda designs; \ndisappointment prevails with regard to the efficacy of \nthe policies and actions of the international \norganizations in the establishment of durable peace and \nsecurity, and the protection of human rights is being \nweakened. I plan to touch upon and explain the roots of \nand solutions to these predicaments and some of the \nprincipal challenges facing our world. I will also speak \nto you about the need to remedy the present situation, \nabout prospects for a brighter and a more hopeful \nfuture and about the appearance of the sublime, about \nbeauty, compassion and generosity, about justice and \nthe blossoming of all God-given human talents and \nabout the prominence of faith in God and the \nrealization of the promise of God. I will then submit \nfor your judgement the question of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme as a yardstick for the measurement of \nhonesty, efficacy, steadfastness and accomplishment. In \nthe closing part of my statement, I will offer my \nproposals. \n As you are all aware, mankind is currently facing \nimportant, numerous and diverse challenges. I will \nrefer to some of them. \n First, organized attempts to destroy the institution \nof family and to weaken the status of women. Family is \nthe most sacred and valuable human institution. It is \nthe centre of the purest mutual love and affection \nbetween mothers, fathers and children, provides a safe \nenvironment for the nurturing of human generations \nand serves as a fertile ground for the blossoming of \ntalent and compassion. This institution has been \nrespected in all times by all peoples, religions and \ncultures. Today we are witnessing an organized attack \nby the enemies and plunderers of humanity, who are \ntrying to destroy this noble institution by promoting \nlewdness and violence and by crossing the boundaries \nof chastity and decency. \n Womanhood, as the manifestation of divine \nbeauty and supreme kindness, affection and purity, has \nbeen heavily exploited in recent decades by the holders \nof power and the owners of media and wealth. In some \nsocieties, womanhood has been reduced to a mere \ninstrument of publicity, and all the boundaries and \nprotective shields of chastity, purity and beauty have \nbeen trampled. That is a colossal betrayal of human \nsociety and of future generations, and it is an \nirreparable blow to the pillar of social coherence, the \nfamily. \n I now turn to the issues of widespread violations \nof human rights, terrorism and occupation. \nUnfortunately, human rights are being extensively \nviolated by certain Powers   especially those who \npretend to be their exclusive advocates. Setting up \nsecret prisons, abducting persons, carrying out trials \nand secret punishments without any regard for due \nprocess, conducting extensive tapping of telephone \nconversations, intercepting private mail and issuing \nfrequent summonses to appear at police and security \ncentres have become commonplace and prevalent. \nThese Powers prosecute scientists and historians for \nstating their opinions on important global issues. \n They use various pretexts to occupy sovereign \nStates and cause insecurity and division, and then use \nthe prevailing situation as an excuse to continue their \noccupation. For more than 60 years, Palestine, as \ncompensation for the loss that it incurred during the \nwar in Europe, has been under the occupation of the \nillegal Zionist regime. The Palestinian people have \nbeen displaced, are under heavy military pressure or \neconomic siege or are incarcerated under abhorrent \nconditions. The occupiers are protected and praised, \nwhile the innocent Palestinians are subjected to \npolitical, military and propaganda onslaughts. The \npeople of Palestine are deprived of water, electricity \nand medicine for the sin of asking for freedom, and the \nGovernment that was freely elected by the people is \ntargeted. Terrorists are being organized to attack the \nlives and property of people with the blessings of the \npoliticians and military officials of the great Powers. \n The brutal Zionists carry out targeted \nassassinations of Palestinians in their homes and cities, \nand terrorists are decorated with medals of peace and \nreceive support from the great Powers. On the other \nhand, they attract a number of Jews from various parts \nof the world by using false propaganda and by \npromising to provide them with welfare, jobs and food, \nand then settle them in the occupied territories, \nexposing them to the harshest restrictions, \npsychological pressures and constant threats. They \nprevent these people from returning to their homelands \nand, by coercion and propaganda, incite them to \nmalevolence towards the indigenous Palestinian \npeople. \n Iraq was occupied under the pretext of \noverthrowing a dictator and the existence of weapons \nof mass destruction. The Iraqi dictator, who had been \nsupported by the same occupiers, was disposed of, and \nno weapons of mass destruction were discovered, but \nthe occupation continues under different pretexts. No \nday passes by without people being killed, wounded or \ndisplaced, and the occupiers not only refuse to be \naccountable for and ashamed of their military \nadventure, but speak in a report of a new market for \ntheir armaments as a result of it. They even oppose the \nConstitution, the National Assembly and the \nGovernment established by the vote of the people, \nwhile not even having the courage to declare their \ndefeat and to leave Iraq. \n Unfortunately, we are witnessing the bitter truth \nthat some Powers do not value any nation or human \nbeing and that the only things that matter to them are \nthemselves and their political parties and groups. In \ntheir view, human rights amount to profits for their \ncompanies and their friends. The rights and the dignity \nof American people are also being sacrificed for the \nselfish desires of those holding power. \n I shall now discuss aggressions against \nindigenous cultures and national values. Culture is the \nmanifestation of identity, the key to the survival of \nnations and the foundation for their interaction with \nothers. In an organized movement, indigenous cultures \nthat are messengers of monotheism, love and fraternity \nare being subjected to broad and destructive \naggressions. National customs and values are being \nhumiliated, and the self-esteem and character of \nnations are being ridiculed and defamed. The purpose \nis to promote blind emulation, consumerism, \nscepticism towards God and human values and the \nplundering of the peoples\u2019 wealth by great Powers. \n With regard to poverty, illiteracy, health-care \nissues and the gap between the rich and the poor, I \nshould like to say that, while a major part of the natural \nenvironment in Asia, Africa and Latin America is being \nplundered by the political and economic domination of \ncertain Powers, the situation of poverty and deprivation \nis alarming.  \n Let me draw the attention of the Assembly to \nsome data issued by the United Nations. Every day, \nnearly 800 million people go to bed hungry and about \n980 million suffer from absolute poverty, having less \nthan a dollar a day in purchasing power. People in \n31 countries   equivalent to 9 per cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation   have an average life expectancy of \n46 years, which is 32 years fewer than the average in \ndeveloped countries. The gap between the rich and the \npoor in some parts of the world has increased by \n40 times. In many countries, the majority of the people \nare deprived of access to education and schooling. In \ndeveloping countries, the rate of maternal mortality \nduring pregnancy is 450 per 100,000; that figure is 7 in \nthe richer nations. The infant mortality rate is 59 per \n1,000 live births for the developing countries and 6 for \nthe richer nations. One third of the deaths throughout \nthe world   or 50,000 deaths daily   result from \npoverty. I believe that those data clearly demonstrate \nthe tragic situation dominating economic interactions \nin the world. \n Next, I shall take up the forsaking of noble values \nand the promotion of deception and lies. Some Powers \nsacrifice all human values, including honesty, purity \nand trust, for the advancement of their goals. They \npropagate scepticism and deception in the relations \nbetween States and peoples. They lie openly, level \nbaseless charges against others, act in contradiction to \nlegal norms and damage the atmosphere of trust and \nfriendship. In their relations with others, they openly \nabandon morality and noble values, forsaking justice, \nrespect for others, love, affection and honesty for \nselfishness, supremacy, enmity and imposition. They \nsacrifice all the good things of life, including the \nsublime, for their own greed. \n I now turn to violations of rules of international \nlaw and disrespect for commitments. Some, who \nthemselves have drafted international law, openly and \neasily violate it and apply discriminatory policies and \ndouble standards to others. Having drafted \ndisarmament regulations, they daily test and stockpile \nnew generations of lethal weapons. Having helped to \nframe the Charter of the United Nations, they show \ndisrespect for the right of sovereign nations to self-\ndetermination and independence. They conveniently \nabrogate their formal treaties and do not yield to laws \nconcerning protection of the environment. Most of the \nviolations of international obligations are committed \nby a few global Powers. \n I will now talk about an escalation of threats and \nthe arms race. Some Powers, whenever their logic fails, \nsimply use the language of threats. The huge arms race \ncasts its menacing shadow over the entire globe. The \nnations of Europe were the victims of two world wars \nand a number of other devastating conflicts and were \nsubjected to the consequences of the cold war for many \ndecades. Today, Europeans are living under threat and \ntheir interests, security and lands are endangered \nbecause of the arms race carried on by certain big \nPowers. \n A bullying Power arrogates to itself the right to \nset up a missile system, poisons the life of the peoples \nof a continent and lays the ground for an arms race. \nSome rulers who superficially appear to be powerful \nactually believe that the tools they have at hand can be \nused at any time and for any purpose and, \nconsequently, threaten others and cast the shadow of \ninsecurity over nations and regions. \n International organizations and mechanisms \nclearly lack the capacity to overcome problems and \nchallenges, to put in place fair and just relations and \npeace, fraternity and security. There is hardly a \nGovernment or nation that really trusts these \nmechanisms to secure its rights or defend its \nindependence, territorial integrity and national \ninterests. \n There are many more challenges besides the ones \nI have enumerated. I know that I could have introduced \nmore had I wanted to touch upon them, but I chose to \nconfine myself to the ones I have stated. Now, the \nimportant and decisive question concerns the roots and \ncauses of these challenges. A scientific and careful \nanalysis shows that two fundamental factors account \nfor the present situation. Without a doubt, the first \nfactor is the relations arising from the consequences of \nthe Second World War. The victors of the war drew the \nroad map for global domination and formulated their \npolicies on the basis not of justice but of safeguarding \nthe interests of the victors over the vanquished nations. \nTherefore, for 60 years now, mechanisms arising from \nthis approach and related policies have been incapable \nof finding just solutions for global problems. Some big \nPowers still behave like the victors of the World War \nand regard other States and nations, even those that had \nnothing to do with the war, as the vanquished. They \nhumiliate other nations and make extortionate \ndemands. Their condescending ways are reminiscent of \nmedieval times and the old lord-serf relationship. They \nbelieve that they should have more rights than others \nand that they are not accountable to any international \norganization. \n Unfortunately, among all the ineffective bodies, \nthe United Nations Security Council ranks first; owing \nto circumstances in which some Powers with an \nexclusive and special right to the veto in the Security \nCouncil act as prosecutor, judge and executioner. It is \nnatural that countries that have been subjected to those \nPowers\u2019 infringements of their rights have no hope of \ngetting what they deserve from the Council. \n Regrettably, humanity has witnessed that in all \nlong wars   like the Korean and Viet Nam wars, the \nwar of the Zionists against the Palestinians and against \nLebanon, the war of Saddam against the people of Iran \nand the ethnic wars of Europe and Africa   one \nSecurity Council member was one of the belligerents \nor supported one party, usually the aggressor, against \nthe other, or the conflict itself. \n Let us take a look at Iraq. They first occupied the \ncountry and then received authorization from the \nSecurity Council   the same Council in which the \nsame occupiers have the right of veto. Whom should \nthe people of Iraq complain about, and where should \nthey take their complaints, in the hope of securing their \nrights? \n We saw in Lebanon that some Powers, for 33 \nlong days, prevented the Security Council from taking \nany action against the Zionist regime with the hope of \ngiving it time to achieve victory. Then, when they \nbecame disappointed at seeing their hopes unfulfilled, \nthey decided to put an end to the hostilities by adopting \na resolution. But the duty of the Security Council is to \nprevent the expansion of conflicts, to put ceasefires in \nplace and to promote peace and security. To whom and \nto what organization should the people of Lebanon \ncomplain? \n The presence of some monopolistic Powers has \nprevented the Security Council from performing its \nmain duty, which is the maintenance of international \npeace and security based on justice. The credibility of \nthe Council has been tarnished, and its efficacy in \ndefending the rights of United Nations Member States \nhas been undermined. Many nations have lost their \nconfidence in the Council. Some other mechanisms, \nsuch as monetary and banking ones, are in the same \nundesirable situation and have been turned into tools \nthat enable some Powers to impose their will on other \nnations. It is evident that these mechanisms are not \ncapable of responding to current needs, solving \nchallenges or establishing fair and sustainable \nrelations. \n Again, there is no doubt that the second and more \nimportant factor is that some big Powers disregard \nmorals, divine values, the teachings of the prophets and \nthe will of the Almighty. They allow the rule of the \nincompetent. How can the incompetent, who cannot \neven manage themselves and conduct their own affairs, \ngovern humanity and arrange its affairs? Unfortunately, \nthese people have put themselves in the position of \nGod. They are in servitude to their own whims, and \nthey desire to have everything for themselves. For \nthem, human dignity and the lives, property and \nterritories of others are no longer respected. For \ncenturies, humanity has had a deep wound inflicted on \nits tired body by impious Powers. Today, the problems \nthat people around the world face are mainly rooted in \ndisregard for human values and ethics, as well as in the \nrule of the selfish and the incompetent. \n The only sustainable approach to the betterment \nof humankind is a return to the teachings of the divine \nprophets, monotheism, respect for the dignity of \nhumans and the flow of love and affection in all \nrelationships, ties and regulations, and the reform of \npresent structures on this basis. To fulfil this objective, \nI invite everybody to form a front of fraternity, amity \nand sustainable peace, based on monotheism and \njustice, under the name of the Coalition for Peace, to \nprevent incursions and arrogance and to promote the \nculture of affection and justice. I hereby announce that, \nwith the help of all independent, justice-seeking and \npeace-loving nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran will \nbe heading down this path. \n Monotheism, justice and compassion for humans \nshould predominate in all the pillars of the United \nNations, and this Organization should be a forum for \njustice, where every member should enjoy equal \nspiritual and legal support. The General Assembly, \nrepresenting the international community, should be \nconsidered the most important pillar of the United \nNations and should, free from any pressure or threats \nby big Powers, take the required measures for the \nreform of the other United Nations structures including \nespecially the reform of the Security Council. It should \ndefine new structures based on justice and democracy, \nwith a view to becoming responsive to present \nrequirements and settling existing challenges, thereby \nbringing about enduring stability and security.  \n The nuclear issue of Iran is a clear example of \nhow such mechanisms perform and of the prevailing \nthoughts behind them. Members are all aware that Iran \nis a member of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) and has always observed its rules and \nregulations. It has had the most extensive cooperation \nwith that Agency in all areas. All our nuclear activities \nhave been completely peaceful and transparent. \n According to the Statute of the IAEA, every \nmember has a number of rights and obligations. In fact, \nall members have to stay on a peaceful path and, under \nthe supervision of the Agency, assist other members, \nand they are entitled to be supported by the Agency \nand have access to the fuel cycle with the help of the \nAgency and its members. \n Thus far, Iran has fulfilled all of its obligations \nbut has been deprived of other members\u2019 technical \nassistance and, even at times, of the Agency\u2019s support. \nFor about five years, some of the aforementioned \nPowers have, by exerting heavy pressure on the IAEA, \nattempted to prevent the Iranian nation from exercising \nits rights. They have derailed Iran\u2019s nuclear issue from \nits legal tracks, and have politicized the atmosphere to \nimpose their wishes through taking advantage of all \ntheir potential. \n The Government of Iran spared no effort to build \nconfidence, but they were not satisfied with anything \nshort of the complete halt of all activities, even those \nrelated to research and university fields. They only \nsought to deprive the Iranian people of all their \ninalienable rights, even to the extent that centres not \ninvolved in the fuel cycle or not in need of supervision \nby the Agency were closed. \n After three years of negotiations and attempts to \nbuild confidence, the Iranian nation came to the firm \nbelief that the main concern of these Powers is not the \npossible deviation of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, but is to \nprevent its scientific progress under that pretext. If this \ntrend continues, there will be no possibility for Iran to \nenjoy its rights, not even in the next 20 years. \nTherefore, Iran decided to pursue the issue through its \nappropriate legal path, one that runs through the IAEA, \nand to disregard unlawful and political impositions by \nthe arrogant Powers. \n In the past two years, abusing the Security \nCouncil, the arrogant Powers have repeatedly accused \nIran and have even made military threats and imposed \nillegal sanctions against it. However, by the grace of \nfaith in God and national unity, Iran has moved \nforward step by step, and now our country is \nrecognized as one with the capacity for industrial-scale \nfuel cycle production for peaceful uses. Unfortunately, \nthe Security Council, in dealing with this obvious legal \nissue, was influenced by some bullying Powers and \nfailed to uphold justice and protect the rights of the \nIranian people. \n Fortunately, the IAEA has recently tried to regain \nits legal role as supporter of the rights of its members \nwhile supervising nuclear activities. We see this as a \ncorrect approach adopted by the Agency. Previously, \nthey illegally insisted on politicizing the Iranian \nnation\u2019s nuclear case, but today, because of the \nresistance of the Iranian nation, the issue is back with \nthe Agency, and I officially announce that, in our \nopinion, the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has \nturned into an ordinary Agency matter. Today, many \nimportant questions have been raised about the nuclear \nactivities of certain Powers within the IAEA, which \nshould be dealt with properly. Of course, Iran has \nalways been, and will be, prepared to have constructive \ntalks with all parties. \n I would like to thank all the nations and countries \nthat, during this difficult period, defended the legal \nrights of my nation and motherland. I also want to \nexpress our appreciation to the members of the  \nNon-Aligned Movement, our friends in the Security \nCouncil and in the IAEA Board of Governors, the \ncommitted and law-abiding experts of the Agency and \nits Director General for standing by the law. I would \nalso like to announce that, unlike the monopolistic \nPowers, the Iranian nation is ready to offer to other \nmembers its experiences in the form of educational \nprogrammes, based on its obligations under the \nAgency\u2019s Statute and under Agency supervision. \n Now I would like to address those who have \nshown hostility towards the Iranian nation for some \nfive years and who have offended and accused my \npeople, who have contributed to the history and \ncivilization of the world. I advise them to learn from \nhistory and their recent actions. They badly mistreated \nthe great Iranian nation, but they should be careful not \nto inflict the same on other members of international \norganizations, and not to sacrifice the dignity of \ninternational organizations for the sake of their \nunlawful wishes. Today the nations of the world are \nwide awake and resistant. If those Powers reform \nthemselves, the whole world will be reformed. Nations \nare inherently good and can coexist peacefully. \n Those Powers should endeavour to serve their \nown peoples; others do not need them. Is it not high \ntime for these Powers to return from the path of \narrogance and obedience to Satan to the path of faith in \nGod? Would they not like to be cleansed of their \nimpurities, submit to the will of God and believe in \nhim? Faith in God means believing in honesty, purity, \njustice and compassion for others. They can be certain \nthat they will benefit from purity, honesty, justice and \nloving and respecting human dignity. They can also be \ncertain that such values are, more and more, considered \nappropriate, valuable and beautiful by the nations of \nthe world. \n This is the invitation of all the divine prophets \nfrom Adam to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and \nMohammed, peace be upon him. If they accept this \ninvitation, they will be saved, and if they do not, the \nsame calamities that befell the people of the distant \npast will befall them as well. According to the holy \nQuran: One who does not answer the divine call \nshould not think that he has weakened God on Earth; \nhe has no companion but God and he is clearly \nengulfed by darkness\u201d. They have nothing of their own \nand cannot escape from the dominion of the rule of \nGod and his will. \n At this important gathering, I have to remind \nthem of the following words of the Almighty, which \nare mentioned in the Holy Quran:  \n Do they not look at the powers and \nGovernments which came before them? If the \npeople of the past had actually possessed \nsomething, they would have kept it and would not \nhave let you possess it now. God destroyed them \nbecause of their sins, and nobody could protect \nthem against the will of God. \n These Powers have to know that thoughts and \nmethods based on oppression and injustice are doomed \nto failure. Do they not see the signs of vigilance and \nresistance based on monotheism, philanthropy and the \njustice-seeking spirit of the nations of the world? Do \nthey not notice that we are nearing the sunset of the \ntime of empires? I hope that this invitation will have a \npractical answer. \n Peoples and Governments are not obliged to obey \nthe injustice of certain Powers. Those Powers, for the \nreasons already mentioned, have lost the competence to \nlead the world. I officially declare that the age of \nrelations arising from the Second World War and of \nmaterialistic thought based on arrogance and \ndomination is well over now. Humanity has passed a \nperilous precipice and the age of monotheism, purity, \naffinity, respect for others, justice and true peace-\nloving has commenced. \n It is the divine promise that the truth will be \nvictorious and the Earth will be inherited by the \nrighteous. Those who are free, believers and the people \nof the world should put their trust in God. Those who \ncrave lofty values, wherever they are, should try to \nprepare the grounds for the fulfilment of that great \ndivine promise by serving the people and seeking \njustice. \n The era of darkness will end, prisoners will return \nhome, the occupied lands will be freed, Palestine and \nIraq will be liberated from the domination of the \noccupiers, and the peoples of America and Europe will \nbe free of the pressures exerted by the Zionists. \nTenderhearted and humanity-loving Governments will \nreplace the aggressive and domineering. Human \ndignity will be regained. The pleasing aroma of justice \nwill permeate the world and people will live together in \na brotherly and affectionate manner. \n Striving in that way to surrender rule to the \nrighteous and perfect human, the promised one, is \nindeed the final cure for the wounds of humanity, the \nsolution of all problems, and the establishment of love, \nbeauty, justice and a dignified life throughout the \nworld. That belief and endeavour is the key to unity \nand constructive interaction among nations, countries, \nthe people of the world and all true justice-seekers. \nWithout a doubt, the promised one who is the ultimate \nsaviour, along with Jesus Christ and other holy \nprophets, will come. In the company of all believers, \njustice-seekers and benefactors, he will establish a \nbright future and fill the world with justice and beauty. \nThat is the promise of God; therefore it will be \nfulfilled. Let us play a part in the fulfilment of all that \nglory and beauty. \n I wish for a bright future for all human beings, \nthe dawn of the liberation of and freedom for all \nhumans, the rule of love and affection all around the \nworld, as well as the elimination of oppression, hatred \nand violence   a wish that I expect to be fulfilled in \nthe near future. \n",

        "year": 2007,
        "country": "IND",
        "text": "Kindly accept my \ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \nMy delegation assures you of its full cooperation as we \naddress issues identified in the annual report of the \nSecretary-General (A\/62\/1) and as we responsibly and \ncreatively move forward with pending reforms of the \nOrganization. \n At the outset I would like to express India\u2019s deep \ngratitude to all Member States for the recent \nunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of \nresolution 61\/271, deciding to annually observe the \nInternational Day of Non-Violence, on 2 October, the \nanniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. I also \nlook forward to participation by Member States in the \ninformal plenary meeting of the General Assembly and \nother functions being organized tomorrow at the United \nNations to mark the first International Day of \nNon-Violence. \nA central topic for this year\u2019s debate   \nresponding to climate change   is both timely and \nrelevant. India\u2019s views on it were recently set forth at \nthe high-level event on climate change, which took \nplace here on 24 September. Combined with the \nexchange of views in the general debate, it will no \ndoubt provide a useful backdrop to the meeting of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange to be held later this year in Bali, Indonesia.  \n The impact of climate change and environmental \ndegradation falls disproportionately upon developing \ncountries. Developing countries are the most \nvulnerable to it, and also lack the means to tackle it. \nMeasures to address climate change must be based on \nmitigation and adaptation strategies with fair burden-\nsharing and measures to realize sustainable patterns of \nconsumption and production. The process of burden-\nsharing must also take into account where the primary \nresponsibility for the present state of greenhouse gas \nconcentration in the atmosphere rests and not foreclose \nrapid and sustained economic development for the \ndeveloping world, which, in any case, is an imperative \nfor adaptation. \n Technology is the other key area that needs to be \naddressed. It is important that critical clean \ntechnologies be made available and affordable to \ndeveloping countries. The intellectual property rights \nregime must balance rewards for innovators with the \ncommon good of humankind. Concerted international \naction to address climate change, in accordance with \nthe principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as \nnational circumstances and social and economic \nconditions, is the need of the hour. India, for which \nenergy security is a national imperative, has a very \nsmall individual carbon footprint, with per capita \ncarbon dioxide emissions at just about a quarter of the \nworld\u2019s average. Even so, we are determined that, as \nwe pursue economic growth, our per capita greenhouse \ngas emissions will not increase beyond those of the \nindustrial countries. \n Poverty and underdevelopment are amongst the \ncentral challenges of our times. The overarching \nrequirement is for sustained economic growth to \neradicate poverty in developing countries. However, \neconomic growth must also be measured against the \ntemplate of social inclusion. Growth alone is not \nenough if it does not produce benefits that are \nsufficiently dispersed, not only in terms of increased \nincome and employment, but also for improved health, \nnutrition and education for all. \n I affirm India\u2019s resolve to achieve the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Government \nof India accords the highest priority to inclusive \ngrowth, including the political, legal, educational and \neconomic empowerment of women, effective and \naffordable public health, and enhanced access to \neducational opportunities, especially for all those who \nare disadvantaged. \n It is apparent that progress in the achievement of \nthe internationally agreed development goals has been \ntardy. The international community, through the United \nNations system, must more effectively support the \nefforts of developing countries to achieve the \ndevelopment goals. A comprehensive reform of the \ninternational financial architecture is a key ingredient \nin that process. The United Nations must play an \nimportant role in overseeing the reform of the \ninternational financial architecture. That should include \nmeasures to ensure a greater voice for and participation \nby developing countries in the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. The process of reform must be carried to \nits logical conclusion if the credibility of those \ninstitutions is to be enhanced. \n We must also address as a priority the regrettable \ninversion of global resource flows. Today, instead of \nthe urgently needed inflow of resources to developing \ncountries to buttress their national economic \ndevelopment plans, we are confronted with a net \noutflow from them. Official development assistance \n(ODA) showed a marked fall during 2006 and remains \nwell below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nproduct. It is primarily being used to finance debt \nrelief. That this is happening after so many years of \nliberalization and globalization highlights our \ncollective failure. Perhaps we should be considering \nmechanisms, such as an international debt commission, \nto redress the problem of developing country debt.  \n The least developed countries, which are \nparticularly hard hit by rising energy costs, find \nthemselves in an even more difficult situation. \nEnhanced and predictable resource flow to developing \ncountries remains a key objective of the global \npartnership for development. India will continue to do \nwhat it can to help with capacity-building in other \ndeveloping countries and to assist them through ODA \nwithin the limits of its capacity. By the end of the year, \nimports from least developed countries into India will \nface a zero-tariff regime. \n Early and substantive progress at the Doha Round \nof trade negotiations, based on the primacy of the \ndevelopment dimension, is another imperative. We \nmust return to the negotiating table with a redoubled \nsense of urgency, while recognizing that adherence to \nthe existing mandate remains critical. Nor can the \ninterests of subsistence farmers be ignored or equated \nwith those of other sectors. An illogical linkage \nbetween agriculture and non-agricultural market access \nwill only complicate the development impact of the \nRound. The overarching principle of special and \ndifferential treatment for developing countries remains \na categorical imperative. \n As part of India's commitment to the \nachievement of human rights for all, and as a member \nof the Human Rights Council, we remain actively \ninvolved in developing the institutional framework of \nthat body, including the universal periodic review \nmechanism, based on effective international \ncooperation as a central principle in the Council\u2019s \nmethods of work. India will work towards developing \nan international normative framework for the \npromotion and protection of human rights. India is \nhonoured to be one of the first signatories of the \nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. Earlier today, I \nalso had the honour of depositing India\u2019s instrument of \nratification of the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities.  \n As the largest democracy in the world, India has \ndeveloped a system of local self-government with \ndemocratically elected institutions of representative \nGovernment at all levels   the village, the district, the \nState and the nation. The effort to make participatory \ndemocracy more meaningful to every Indian citizen \nunderpins what is perhaps one of the greatest social \nexperiments in the world today, namely, the transfer of \ndecision-making power to nearly one million elected \nwomen local Government representatives. As a result, \nwomen are not merely the beneficiaries of change in \nIndia, but are its instruments. \n As the world\u2019s largest democracy, it was also \nnatural for India to support the establishment of the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund. We made an initial \ncontribution of $10 million to the Fund and remain \nactively and constructively involved in realizing the \nobjectives for which it was set up. As a small token of \nour commitment to that laudable initiative, I have the \nprivilege of announcing a further pledge of $10 million \nto the United Nations Democracy Fund. \n The international system cannot be reordered \nmeaningfully without a comprehensive reform of the \nUnited Nations. If the Organization is to remain the \ncornerstone of the international architecture in this \ncentury, it cannot remain mired in the realities of the \n1940s. Despite substantive implementation of the \nUnited Nations reform agenda that emerged from the \n2005 World Summit Outcome, such reform will \ninevitably remain incomplete without comprehensive \nreform and expansion of the Security Council and \nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Elements and \nideas on the reform of the Security Council have been \ndiscussed for well over a decade in numerous reports \nand interminable consultations. It is now time for \nintergovernmental negotiations to commence in order \nto make the Security Council more democratic, \nrepresentative and responsive.  \n We, together with partners from Africa, Latin \nAmerica and Asia, tabled a resolution on 11 September \n2007, spelling out the principles on which reform \nought to be based if it is to be meaningful. These \nprinciples are expansion in both permanent and \nnon-permanent categories of membership; greater \nrepresentation for developing countries and \nrepresentation for developed countries that is reflective \nof contemporary world realities; and comprehensive \nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \nCouncil, including ensuring greater access for island \nand small States. We welcome recent statements from \nthis podium by President Bush of the United States of \nAmerica and other world leaders on the need for \nSecurity Council reform in both the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories. It is high time that we \ncollectively bring these ideas to implementation. \n Reform of the United Nations would also be \nincomplete without revitalization of the General \nAssembly. The central goal of such revitalization must \nbe the restoration and enhancement of the role and \nauthority of the General Assembly as originally \nenvisaged in the Charter. \n Given the significance of developmental \nactivities for the developing world, India sees a \ncorresponding need for the reform of United Nations \noperational activities in favour of development. Since \nthese activities are aimed at supporting the work of \nMember States, it follows that Members must \ndetermine their direction and shape through an \nintergovernmental process. The litmus test for any \nreform proposal is whether it improves the support \nextended by the United Nations to the efforts of \nprogramme countries. India would therefore judge \nreform proposals by their impact on the ground, by the \nresultant improvement in the effectiveness of the \nsystem and by the impact on transaction costs for the \nUnited Nations development system. \n Steps to achieve the complete elimination of \nnuclear weapons have also only made limited headway. \nDespite some progress, the world remains far from \nachieving the objective of total elimination of nuclear \nweapons. India\u2019s long-standing commitment to \nuniversal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive \nnuclear disarmament is embodied in the vision of late \nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-free and \nnon-violent world. This vision was put forward nearly \ntwo decades ago. It remains undiminished today.  \n Indeed, it is all the more relevant today, given the \nfact that peaceful uses of nuclear energy can address \nthe inexorably growing demand for new and  \nnon-polluting sources of energy to fuel economic \ndevelopment. We will be bringing proposals to \nMember States and this Organization to see how we \ncan refocus on general and complete disarmament, \nparticularly nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is our \nagreed goal, and it subsumes arms control and \nnon-proliferation. \n It is well known that India has an impeccable \nrecord in preventing the proliferation of sensitive \ntechnologies. That is in keeping with our commitment \nto being a responsible nuclear Power. India is ready to \nwork with the international community to develop a \nnew international consensus on non-proliferation. The \ninternational community needs to intensify the effort to \naddress the very real threat posed by the link between \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n(WMDs) and related materials and technologies and \nthe ability of non-State actors to acquire them. The risk \nposed by the intersection between proliferation and \nterrorism is real and serious. The central objective must \nbe to ensure that our solidarity in words is translated \ninto action. \n The adoption of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy last September was a \nnoteworthy development, signalling the will of the \ninternational community to combat this menace in a \nholistic and coordinated manner. Welcome as the \nStrategy is, there is much more that needs to be done to \ncombat the menace that international terrorism has \nbecome. India is convinced that without the early \nadoption of a comprehensive convention against \ninternational terrorism, the global struggle against \nterrorism remains incomplete and likely to succeed \nonly partially. We must ensure that there is zero \ntolerance for all forms of terrorism. \n In conclusion, I would express the hope that our \ndeliberations in the year ahead will lead us to \nenlightened action. With maturity and resolve we will \nsuccessfully overcome the many challenges before us. \n",

        "text": "I am  honoured to address the General Assembly as the first \nPrime Minister of a constitutionally permanent \nGovernment representing Iraq, its people, and its \naspirations in cementing the foundations of democracy, \npeace, freedom and cooperation with the international \ncommunity. I come carrying the concerns of the people \nof the Valley of Two Rivers who built the most ancient \ncivilization and established the first laws, and who \ntoday offer humanity a lofty example in sustaining life, \nfacing challenges, and persisting in protecting our \nyoung democratic experience. \n The Iraqi people lived isolated from the world in \nthe shadow of dictatorship for 35 years. There was no \nfreedom of expression or belief, no multiple party \nsystem, no free elections, no democratic institutions, \nno communications systems, and no media except \nthose that were controlled by the Government \nintelligence agencies. \nMillions of victims in Iraq suffered throughout \nthat era in adventurous wars with two neighbouring \ncountries, Iran and Kuwait. Genocidal mass murder \nwas committed inside Iraq, such as during the \nal-Anfaal campaign and in Halabja. In addition, there \nwere mass graves, horrific prison cells and detention \ncamps, and the immense destruction that plagued the \ninfrastructure of the various governmental institutions. \n Today in the new Iraq, there are hundreds of \nparties active within 20 political alliances. There are \nmore than 6,000 civil society organizations, hundreds \nof newspapers and magazines, 40 local and satellite TV \nstations, as well as the offices of foreign \ncorrespondents from all over the world working \nwithout restrictions or conditions. \n The new Iraq is being targeted today. Terrorism \nkills civilians, journalists, artists, intellectuals and \nprofessionals; it attacks universities, marketplaces and \nlibraries; it blows up mosques and churches and \ndestroys the infrastructure of State institutions. We \nconsider terrorism to be an extension of the fallen \ndictatorship, although it may vary in its external form \nor in the gangs that carry it out. Terrorism seeks to \nabort the political process and to ignite sectarian strife \nas a prelude to hijacking Iraq back into the era of \ntyranny, oppression and backwardness. \n Car bombs, explosive vests in public places and \nthe display of decapitated heads on television are all \nmessages of threat and intimidation that terrorists send \nto the world community, the bloody chapters of which \nwere executed in Algeria, Spain, England, France, \nLebanon, Turkey and here in New York. We are \nsteadfast and determined to exterminate and defeat \nterrorism in Iraq so that it does not spread through the \ncountries of the world, repeating the tragedy. \n Iraq, which carries the greater burden in \nconfronting terrorism, calls upon the nations of the \nworld to help and join in its efforts to fight the scourge \nof terrorism. Our battle aims at providing security, \nstability and prosperity, and at protecting our \ndemocratic experience. We are determined to be \nvictorious in our battle, which will be a victory for \nhumanity. The fierce onslaught of terror against Iraq \nsince the fall of the dictatorship has not stopped our \npeople, through three epic elections, from laying the \ngroundwork for a democratic experience unique in \nIraq\u2019s history and the region, in which, as a permanent \nConstitution was voted upon, a parliament was elected \nand a National Unity Government was established. \n The new Iraq living through its nascent \ndemocratic experience is governed by constitutional \ninstitutions, in which freedom of opinion, belief and \nexpression are respected. That Iraq will not retreat \nfrom its democratic option, for which our people have \npaid a very high price. Our position requires the \nsupport and cooperation of the world\u2019s nations so that \nIraq can build a modern State that guarantees justice, \nequality and respect for religious, intellectual, sectarian \nand ethnic pluralism. \n Our people, who have enjoyed the taste of \nfreedom after eras of tyranny and oppression, will \ncontinue on the road towards building a State of \ninstitutions, reinforcing the authority of law, respecting \nhuman rights, and the active participation of women in \nall areas. The national reconciliation and dialogue \ninitiative that I launched upon assuming my \nresponsibility as the Prime Minister of the National \nUnity Government did not come out of thin air. Its \nstrength arises from the Iraqi people\u2019s civilization and \ncultural heritage, which have made great contributions \nto humankind. Iraqis have lived in peace, brotherhood, \nforgiveness and tolerance since the dawn of history. \nTheir religious, national, sectarian and ethnic diversity \nhave been elements of strength, reinforcing national \nunity. \n We think of national reconciliation as a life boat, \na perpetual peace project and a safe harbour for the \npolitical process and the democratic experience. We \nalso believe that national reconciliation is not the \nresponsibility of the Government alone. It is a \ncollective responsibility held by the political powers, \nintellectual leaders, religious leaders, the educated, \ncivil society organizations and all the active powers in \nthe Iraqi arena. National reconciliation is the strategic \nchoice that has saved our country from slipping into \nthe pit of a sectarian war that was planned by the \nenemies of freedom and democracy after they blew up \nthe tomb of the two Askari imams in Samara. \n National reconciliation is not a dinner party \nprepared between those in dispute, nor is it a dose of \nmedicine, as some might think. It is a realistic vision \nthat counteracts the burdensome legacy of the fallen \nregime in all areas. It lays the foundation for political, \nsocial and economic progress and the security that we \nstrive for. Furthermore, it cements the principles of the \nnew political system. \n National reconciliation is the olive branch that \nblossomed into the formation of support councils in \nmany of our provinces and Iraqi cities. It was also \nsuccessful in leading some 28,000 citizens from Iraqi \ntribes to join our military efforts to combat terrorism. It \nhas resulted in the restoration of security in our cities, \nvillages and provinces, including in Al-Anbar \nprovince, which has been liberated from the Al-Qaida \nterrorist organization. The terrorists fled from there, \nonly to face another defeat, this time in Diyala \nprovince. Thus, Al-Qaida is losing its safe havens, one \nby one. \n Indeed, national reconciliation is stronger than \nthe weapons of terrorism. It caused the reintegration of \nmore than 14,000 people who had been members of \narmed groups that splintered off from Al-Qaida. Those \nfighters stood alongside our armed forces and the \nmultinational forces battling Al-Qaida, dealing \ndevastating blows to that terrorist organization.  \n The practical accomplishments that have been \nachieved through constant mobilization for national \nreconciliation are considered important successes, in \ncontrast to the great challenges facing Iraq and the \nexperiences of people who have suffered from \ndictatorships and civil and sectarian wars. \n We emphasize that the acts of sectarian violence \nbeing committed in Iraq are not perpetrated by the \nmain elements of society, but rather by extremists and \nfanatics belonging to various groups. We have been \nsuccessful in largely containing this problem. The \naverage number of sectarian killings has decreased and \nsecurity and stability have been restored in many \nformer hot spots. That has helped the return of \nthousands of displaced families to their homes. We are \nresolved to fight any and all outlaws, regardless of \ntheir sectarian or political affiliations. Our armed \nforces have been steadfast in establishing law and \norder and in instilling a sense of respect for the \nGovernment in many provinces whose residents have \ndiverse religious, sectarian and ethnic affiliations. \n The skills and capabilities of our security and \nmilitary agencies have grown swiftly as they have \nconfronted terrorist organizations, militias and \norganized crime groups. However, they need further \ntraining and development so that they can quickly take \nover from the multinational forces the responsibility \nfor security throughout Iraq. Having proved our ability \nto provide security in eight provinces, we are prepared \nto assume full and swift responsibility for security so \nthat we can protect the democratic achievements of our \npeople. We shall work to ensure that our armed forces \nact in a professional manner and are loyal first and \nforemost to our country, not to an individual party, sect \nor ethnicity. \n In addition to those achievements, the \nGovernment of National Unity has begun the process \nof reconstruction. We have voted on the largest budget \nin Iraq\u2019s contemporary history. With the cooperation of \nparliament, we have adopted the investment law, which \nis considered a step forward that will stimulate the \nIraqi economy and move it from a centrally based \nsystem to one based on free enterprise and a market \neconomy. That in turn will help to fulfil our people\u2019s \naspirations to development, prosperity and well-being. \nIn addition, the Government has finalized a draft law \nfor oil and gas, which if approved by parliament will \nensure fair distribution of wealth, since oil is \nconsidered the property of all Iraqis. \n The Government also continues to adopt and \nimplement other laws in various areas. We have taken \npractical steps to improve our people\u2019s living \nconditions, to increase salaries and pensions, to combat \nunemployment and to expand the efforts of the social \nwelfare network. The Government is determined that \nnext year will be dedicated to promoting the service \nsector in order to alleviate the hardships and suffering \nof our citizens.  \n We understand that these promising steps do not \nfulfil all our aspirations and that we have a long way to \ngo until we achieve our goal of a secure, stable and \nprosperous Iraq. We hope that the international \ncommunity will support Iraq and help it to achieve that \nnoble goal.  \n We believe that security is an integrated system. \nA secure and stable Iraq will be in the best interests of \nthe region and of the world as a whole. We have \nwarned all countries in the region that the relentless \nflow of weapons, money and suicide bombers and the \nspreading of fatwas that incite hatred and murder will \nonly spell disaster for the peoples of the region and the \nentire world. \n After the Government of National Unity was \nformed, we took the initiative to improve Iraq\u2019s \nrelationship with neighbouring countries. We also took \npains to make our common borders peaceful and \neconomically prosperous areas. The foreign policy of \nthe new Iraq is based on our permanent Constitution, \nwhich does not allow our land to be used against our \nneighbours and prohibits foreign interference in our \ninternal affairs. Today, we feel optimistic that countries \nin the region are aware of the danger of the terrorist \nonslaught against Iraq and that a weak Iraq is not in \ntheir interests. A strong and democratic Iraq will be a \nguarantee of security and stability in the region. \n Because of its new policies, Iraq has become a \nplace for negotiations and dialogue between feuding \nregional and international entities. We will take steps to \nreinforce that positive role, adopting a policy of \nimproving conditions, defusing crises and banishing \nthe spectre of war and conflict from the region. We \nfirmly believe that tension and instability undermine \nsecurity not only in Iraq, but throughout the region and \nthe world. \n Iraq, which in recent decades has been a hotbed \nof tension in the region, is now qualified, by virtue of \nits material and human resources, to serve as a \nplatform for regional and international economic \ncooperation. That will contribute to the establishment \nof an economic system that will produce development \nand prosperity for the peoples and countries of the \nregion. \n We also wish to express our sincere desire to \nestablish the best possible relationship with the \ninternational community. We believe that Iraq must be \nopen to all countries, developing relationships and \nbenefiting from the experiences of other democracies. \n As I stand before leaders and representatives of \nthe world\u2019s nations, I must recall that the Iraqi people \ncontinue to pay the price for the reckless politics of the \nprevious, fallen regime and to experience the \nconsequences of international resolutions, especially \nthose relating to its weapons programme and its \ninvasion of the brotherly State of Kuwait. Those \nresolutions, which were exploited by the previous \nregime for political gain, have caused much damage to \nour infrastructure, service sector and education and \nhealth systems. Our people are looking to the \ninternational community for help in repairing that \ndamage and lifting the heavy burdens of debt and \nreparation.  \n The Iraqi people will remember the countries that \nmade sacrifices and stood alongside them in bringing \ndown the dictator\u2019s regime. They will remember those \nwho helped them during the transition to a democratic \nand pluralistic federal system. Moreover, they will \nalways respect and appreciate the countries and \nGovernments that support their political process and \nparticipate in the reconstruction process.  \n Our efforts, in partnership with the international \ncommunity, to achieve economic progress and social \njustice culminated in success with the signing of the \nInternational Compact with Iraq and the \nimplementation of its provisions. That document \nrepresents a new stage in the development of balanced \nrelationships between Iraq and other Governments \nthroughout the world. It is a point of departure in the \nbuilding of a democratic, pluralistic, federal Iraq where \nall citizens are equal and will benefit from fair \ndistribution of wealth after the burdens of debt, \nunemployment, and administrative and financial \ncorruption left over from the days of the former regime \nhave been lifted. \n We hope that the countries concerned will comply \nwith the provisions of the International Compact with \nIraq. That will help the international community and \nencourage it to play its role in reconstruction and \ndevelopment and in supporting national reconciliation \nand the democratic experience. \n Many of the region\u2019s problems and crises can be \nresolved through constructive and focused dialogue. In \norder to maintain peace and security, our region must \nabandon the path of war and adventure, which has led \nto increased harm and suffering for the people. \n Within this framework, we call for recognition of \nthe rights of the Palestinian people, for assistance to \nthem in establishing an independent State, and for the \nreturn of occupied Arab lands in accordance with \ninternational resolutions. The elimination of weapons \nof mass destruction in the Middle East will indeed \nguarantee a just and comprehensive peace.  \n We call for the intensification of national, Arab \nand international efforts to help Lebanon and its \npolitical authorities to transcend the state of division \nand to bar interference in its internal affairs so that \nLebanon can regain its national unity and \ncohesiveness.  \n To forge partnerships and to achieve peace, \nstability and prosperity, we must bolster cooperation \namong all countries of the world and must work \ntogether to attain the noble goals of the United Nations. \nThis also necessitates ensuring equal and balanced \nrelationships among States and developing a more fair \nand just global order by helping economically \ndisadvantaged developing countries and reducing the \ndevelopment gap between poor and rich nations. \n We support an active United Nations role in the \ninternational arena, peacefully resolving crises once it \nattains all the elements and support that it needs to play \nthat important role. We call upon the United Nations to \nadopt peaceful initiatives that can help defuse \nconflicts, save people from the scourge of war and \nestablish international security and stability. That will \nguarantee the rights and interests of all nations and will \nreinforce partnerships and cooperation among them. It \nwill also provide the necessary environment for solving \nthe problems and crises that face the world in a fair and \njust way.  \n Finally, on behalf of the Iraqi people, I wish to \ncongratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also \nwant to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who \nplayed an important role in the United Nations \nadoption of the International Compact with Iraq to help \nIraq carry out its reform programme of political, \neconomic and security reform. My deep appreciation \ngoes also to all countries that signed the Compact. \n",

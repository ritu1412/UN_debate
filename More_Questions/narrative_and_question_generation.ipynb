The speaker highlights that military actions can lead to further instability and conflict, which could have repercussions beyond the immediate area of conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dialogue and Cooperation**: The narrative stresses the importance of dialogue and cooperation among nations to resolve conflicts peacefully. Montenegro advocates for diplomatic solutions and negotiations rather than military interventions.\n",
      "\n",

The sentiment expressed in their speeches ranged from solemn concern to firm opposition against the conditions under which the war was initiated. France emphasized multilateralism, the rule of law, and the importance of United Nations' legitimacy in handling international conflicts.

Key Points:
War Without UN Authorization (2003):

France was deeply concerned that the Iraq War was launched without the authorization of the UN Security Council. This action was seen as a significant challenge to the multilateral system and a deviation from the principles of the UN Charter.
Sovereignty and Stability in Iraq:

France emphasized the importance of transferring sovereignty back to the Iraqi people, believing that Iraqis must be solely responsible for their country's future. Stability and reconstruction were seen as dependent on this transfer of sovereignty.
Role of the United Nations:

France advocated for the UN to play a central role in Iraq's political transition. This included overseeing the transfer of administrative and economic responsibilities, assisting in drafting a constitution, holding elections, and ensuring security through a UN-mandated multinational force.
Non-Commitment to Military Involvement:

France consistently stated its refusal to commit militarily to Iraq, both in the immediate and long-term future. Instead, it expressed willingness to assist in rebuilding Iraq through diplomatic and economic means, alongside its European partners.
Multilateralism and International Law:

France reiterated its belief in multilateralism and the UN's role in maintaining international peace and security. The war in Iraq was framed as an example of the dangers of unilateral military action and the importance of adhering to international law.
Reasoning:
France's opposition to the Iraq War was grounded in a commitment to multilateralism, respect for international law, and the belief that the use of force should only be authorized by the UN Security Council. The country saw the war as a threat to the legitimacy of the United Nations and a potential source of long-term instability in the region. By advocating for a political process led by the Iraqis under UN guidance, France aimed to ensure a more stable and just outcome for Iraq, avoiding the pitfalls of a purely military solution.

This narrative reflects France's broader approach to international relations, emphasizing diplomacy, legal frameworks, and collective action over unilateral decisions and military interventions.
